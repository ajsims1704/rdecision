  abstract = {Diagnostic tests are expensive and time-consuming to develop. Early economic evaluation using decision modeling can reduce commercial risk by providing early evidence on cost-effectiveness. The National Institute for Health Research Diagnostic Evidence Co-operatives (DECs) was established to catalyze evidence generation for diagnostic tests by collaborating with commercial developers; DEC researchers have consequently made extensive use of early modeling. The aim of this article is to summarize the experiences of the DECs using early modeling for diagnostics. We draw on 8 case studies to illustrate the methods, highlight methodological strengths and weaknesses particular to diagnostics, and provide advice. The case studies covered diagnosis, screening, and treatment stratification. Treatment effectiveness was a crucial determinant of cost-effectiveness in all cases, but robust evidence to inform this parameter was sparse. This risked limiting the usability of the results, although characterization of this uncertainty in turn highlighted the value of further evidence generation. Researchers evaluating early models must be aware of the importance of treatment effect evidence when reviewing the cost-effectiveness of diagnostics. Researchers planning to develop an early model of a test should also 1) consult widely with clinicians to ensure the model reflects real-world patient care; 2) develop comprehensive models that can be updated as the technology develops, rather than taking a ?quick and dirty? approach that may risk producing misleading results; and 3) use flexible methods of reviewing evidence and evaluating model results, to fit the needs of multiple decision makers. Decision models can provide vital information for developers at an early stage, although limited evidence mean researchers should proceed with caution.},

A 58-year-old man presented with New York Heart Association class III symptoms from severe mitral regurgitation and significant stenosis of the right coronary artery. In a hybrid operating theater, the patient underwent placement of a bare metal stent in the right coronary artery followed immediately by robotic-assisted mitral valve repair. Both procedures were successful and occurred in a timely fashion. The patient experienced no immediate postoperative complications and was discharged home on postoperative day 5. At 2-week follow-up, he had returned to his normal activities of daily living and at 1 year remained asymptomatic. This case report demonstrates the benefits of minimally invasive robotic mitral valve repair in allowing for successful repair, early postoperative return to activity, minimal incision pain, and high patient satisfaction. It further highlights the potential benefit of a hybrid operating theater in allowing surgical and percutaneous coronary intervention procedures to be delivered in a safe and efficient manner.},

Various studies have used microvascular changes in response to these stimuli, especially ACh iontophoresis and local heating, as a surrogate marker of endothelial function. There are few data in the literature regarding the comparative reproducibility of microvascular perfusion changes induced by the three stimuli. The aim of this study was to systematically assess and compare the reproducibility of skin microcirculatory function in response to each of these challenges. Ten healthy non-smoking subjects (seven males) median age 36 years (range 23-46), with no history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease or any connective tissue disorder, were studied. Changes in skin microcirculation in response to ACh iontophoresis, local heating of the skin and post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia, on two separate days (median 31, range 11-42 days), were assessed in all subjects. We measured three parameters: the change in perfusion from baseline perfusion (peak minus baseline perfusion), the relative percentage change in perfusion from baseline (peak–baseline)/baseline x 100 (\%) and also the time-to-peak perfusion. The reproducibility of the change in perfusion had coefficients of variation (CV) of 9.3\% for local skin heating, 19.4\% for reactive hyperaemia and 25.5\% for ACh iontophoresis. The relative percentage change in perfusion from baseline was more variable with CVs ranging from 23\% to 39\%. The coefficient of variation of time-to-peak perfusion was 7.0\% for heating, 15.1\% for reactive hyperaemia and 10.4\% for ACh iontophoresis. We have shown that microcirculatory changes measured by the change in perfusion from baseline and time-to-peak perfusion in response to ACh, post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia and local skin heating had good reproducibility when carried out in a controlled environment with a standardized protocol. Relative change in perfusion had relatively poor reproducibility. The change in perfusion and time-to-peak perfusion for local skin heating were the most reproducible overall.},

  abstract = {Objective: The Fontan operation greatly improves survival for single ventricle congenital heart disease patients but creates a physiology that leads to long-term multi-organ dysfunction. A non-invasive screening tool that can identify impending decline is sought. The objective of this pilot study was to assess the microcirculation in Fontan-palliated patients by measuring tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) in superficial and deeper tissues. Approach: Three patient cohorts were studied: Fontan group (n\,\,=\,\,8) and two patient control groups, liver disease group (n\,\,=\,\,8) and tetralogy of Fallot group (n\,\,=\,\,9). 22 healthy controls were also examined. Superficial and deeper StO2 was measured at the forearm, thenar eminence, index and ring fingers of both arms using the LEA O2C spectrophotometry device. Main results: Superficial StO2 was reduced in Fontan patients compared to healthy controls (p{$\mkern1mu$}\,\,=\,\,0.002) and tetralogy patients (p{$\mkern1mu$}\,\,=\,\,0.016), but not compared to the liver group (p{$\mkern1mu$}\,\,=\,\,0.313). Deeper StO2 was similar between groups (p{$\mkern1mu$}\,\,=\,\,0.112). The gap between deeper and superficial StO2 was raised in Fontan patients compared to healthy controls (p{$\mkern1mu$}\,\,=\,\,0.001) and tetralogy patients (p{$\mkern1mu$}\,\,=\,\,0.037), but not compared to the liver group (p{$\mkern1mu$}\,\,=\,\,0.504). There was no clinically relevant difference in StO2 between the left and right arms, and the variation in StO2 according to measurement site was similar between the four groups. Significance: Vascular optical spectrophotometry is a feasible non-invasive measure of micro-circulatory function that can easily be performed in the clinic setting and may have utility in patients with Fontan circulations. Further, we provide important normal range data in the healthy control population which can be used to design future studies.},

  abstract = {Summary According to the laryngeal clinical findings, figures making up a scale were assigned to vocally trained and vocally untrained persons suffering from different types of functional dysphonia. The different types of dysphonia—from the manifested hypofunctional to the extreme hypoffunctional dysphonia—were classified by means of this scale. Besides, the subjects' phonetograms were measured and approximated by three ellipses, what rendered possible the definition of phonetogram parameters. The combining of selected phonetogram parameters to linear combinations served the purpose of a phonetographic evaluation. The linear combinations were to bring phonetographic and clinical evaluations into correspondence as accurately as possible. It was necessary to use different kinds of linear combinations for male and female singers and nonsingers. As a result of the reclassification of 71 and the new classification of 89 patients, it was possible to graduate the types of functional dysphonia by means of computer-aided phonetogram evaluation with a clinically acceptable error rate. This method proved to be an important supplement to the conventional diagnostics of functional dysphonia.},

This reports the results of one S's performance in a challenging search task in which 10,215 fixations were accumulated. A number of statistical and spectral tests revealed both fractal and 1/f structure. First, scaling properties emerged in differences across eye positions and their relative dispersion (SD/M)-both decreasing over time. Fractal microstructure also emerged in an iterated function systems test and delay plot. Power spectra obtained from the Fourier analysis of fixations produced brown (1/f2) noise and the spectra of differences across eye positions showed 1/f (pink) noise. Thus, while the sequence of absolute eye positions resembles a random walk, the differences in fixations reflect a longer-term dynamic of 1/f pink noise. Results suggest that memory across eye-movements may serve to facilitate our ability to select out useful information from the environment. The 1/f patterns in relative eye positions together with models of complex systems suggest that our oculomotor system may produce a complex and self-organizing search pattern providing maximum coverage with minimal effort.

DESIGN Prospective, multicenter, observational study. METHOD Patients with significant chronic low back pain underwent implantation of a spinal cord stimulator capable of HF10 SCS. Patients' pain ratings, disability, sleep disturbances, opioid use, satisfaction, and adverse events were assessed for 24 months. RESULTS After a trial period, 88\% (72 of 82) of patients reported a significant improvement in pain scores and underwent the permanent implantation of the system. Ninety percent (65 of 72) of patients attended a 24-month follow-up visit. Mean back pain was reduced from 8.4 ± 0.1 at baseline to 3.3 ± 0.3 at 24 months (P \textbackslash textless 0.001), and mean leg pain from 5.4 ± 0.4 to 2.3 ± 0.3 (P \textbackslash textless 0.001). Concomitantly to the pain relief, there were significant decreases in opioid use, Oswestry Disability Index score, and sleep disturbances. Patients' satisfaction and recommendation ratings were high. Adverse Events were similar in type and frequency to those observed with traditional SCS systems. CONCLUSIONS In patients with chronic low back pain, HF10 SCS resulted in clinically significant and sustained back and leg pain relief, functional and sleep improvements, opioid use reduction, and high patient satisfaction. These results support the long-term safety and sustained efficacy of HF10 SCS.},

  abstract = {The left atrial appendage (LAA) is derived from the left wall of the primary atrium, which forms during the fourth week of embryonic development. It has developmental, ultrastructural, and physiological characteristics distinct from the left atrium proper. The LAA lies within the confines of the pericardium in close relation to the free wall of the left ventricle and thus its emptying and filling may be significantly affected by left ventricular function. The physiological properties and anatomical relations of the LAA render it ideally suited to function as a decompression chamber during left ventricular systole and during other periods when left atrial pressure is high. These properties include the position of the LAA high in the body of the left atrium; the increased distensibility of the LAA compared with the left atrium proper; the high concentration of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) granules contained within the LAA; and the neuronal configuration of the LAA. Thrombus has a predilection to form in the LAA in patients with atrial fibrillation, mitral valve disease, and other conditions. The pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated; however, relative stasis which occurs in the appendage owing to its shape and the trabeculations within it is thought to play a major role. Obliteration or amputation of the LAA may help to reduce the risk of thromboembolism, but this may result in undesirable physiological sequelae such as reduced atrial compliance and a reduced capacity for ANF secretion in response to pressure and volume overload.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a specific training program for ultrasound diagnosis of adnexal masses. METHODS: A 2-month intensive training program was developed. The program protocol consisted of a 1-day intensive theoretical course focused on clinical and sonographic issues related to adnexal masses and ovarian cancer, followed by a 4-week real-time ultrasound training program in a tertiary center (25-30 adnexal masses evaluated per month) and a final 4-week period for offline assessment of three-dimensional (3D) volumes from adnexal masses. In this final period, each trainee evaluated five sets of 100 3D volumes. 3D volumes contained gray-scale and power Doppler information, and the trainee was provided with clinical data for each case (patient age, menopausal status and reported symptoms). 3D volumes were obtained from surgically removed masses that had undergone histological diagnosis or from masses that had been followed up until resolution. After assessment of each set, the trainee's diagnostic performance was calculated (sensitivity and specificity) and each incorrectly classified mass was evaluated with the trainer. The objective was to achieve a sensitivity of \textbackslash textgreater 95\% and a specificity of \textbackslash textgreater 90\%. Learning curve cumulative summation (LC-CUSUM) graphs were plotted to assess the learning curve for the trainees. RESULTS: One trainer and two trainees with little experience in gynecological ultrasound (one gynecologist and one radiologist) participated in this study. LC-CUSUM graphs showed that competence was achieved after 170 or 185 examinations. The objectives for diagnostic performance were achieved after assessment of the second set of 3D volumes (200 cases) for each trainee. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed training program appears to be feasible. High diagnostic performance can be achieved after analysis of 200 cases and maintained thereafter.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies of acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute-on-chronic renal failure (ACRF) are surprisingly sparse and confounded by differences in definition. Reported incidences vary, with few studies being population-based. Given this and our aging population, the incidence of AKI may be much higher than currently thought. We tested the hypothesis that the incidence is higher by including all patients with AKI (in a geographical population base of 523,390) regardless of whether they required renal replacement therapy irrespective of the hospital setting in which they were treated. We also tested the hypothesis that the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-Stage Kidney (RIFLE) classification predicts outcomes. We identified all patients with serum creatinine concentrations ≥150 μmol/L (male) or ≥130μmol/L (female) over a 6-mo period in 2003. Clinical outcomes were obtained from each patient's case records. The incidences of AKI and ACRF were 1811 and 336 per million population, respectively. Median age was 76 yr for AKI and 80.5 yr for ACRF. Sepsis was a precipitating factor in 47\% of patients. The RIFLE classification was useful for predicting full recovery of renal function (P \&lt; 0.001), renal replacement therapy requirement (P \&lt; 0.001), length of hospital stay [excluding those who died during admission (P \&lt; 0.001)], and in-hospital mortality (P = 0.035). RIFLE did not predict mortality at 90 d or 6 mo. Thus the incidence of AKI is much higher than previously thought, with implications for service planning and providing information to colleagues about methods to prevent deterioration of renal function. The RIFLE classification is useful for identifying patients at greatest risk of adverse short-term outcomes.},

A variety of applications is examined, including environmental, pharmaceutical, biological, food and herbal analysis. Reported uses of CL reagents, sample introduction techniques, sample pretreatment methods, CL signal enhancement and detection systems are discussed. A hydrodynamic pumping system is predominately used for these applications. However, several reports are available in which electro-osmotic (EO) pumping has been implemented. Various sample pretreatment methods have been used, including liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction and molecularly imprinted polymers. A wide range of innovative techniques has been reported for CL signal enhancement. Most of these techniques are based on enhancement of the mixing process in the microfluidics channels, which leads to enhancement of the CL signal. However, other techniques are also reported, such as mirror reaction, liquid core waveguide, on-line pre-derivatization and the use of an opaque white chip with a thin transparent seal. Photodetectors are the most commonly used detectors; however, other detection systems have also been used, including integrated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and organic photodiodes (OPDs).

  abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile ('AC') physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying ('DC') baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The review then focuses on the applications of PPG in clinical physiological measurements, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function.},

The frequent finding of autonomic dysfunction and symptoms on standing has the potential to provide a diagnostic biomarker in chronic fatigue. In this study we explored the clinical value of non-invasive optical multi-site photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to assess cardiovascular responses to standing. Multi-site PPG pulses were collected from tissue pads of the ears, fingers and toes of 14 patients with CFS and 14 age-matched sedentary subjects using a measurement protocol of a 10 min baseline (subject supine) followed by 3 min of tilting on a tilt table (head-up to 70°). Percentage change in pulse timing (pulse transit time, PTTf) and pulse amplitude (AMP) at each site were calculated using beat-to-beat pulse wave analysis. A significant reduction in the overall pulse timing response to controlled standing was found for the CFS group (using summed absolute percentage change in PTTf for ear, finger and toe sites, median change of 26\% for CFS and 37\% for control with p = 0.002). There were no significant differences between subject groups for the AMP measure at any site. Changes in AMP with tilt were, however, weakly significantly and negatively correlated with fatigue severity (p \textbackslash textless 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of timing measures produced an area under the curve of 0.81. Experimental linear discriminant classification analysis comparing both timing and amplitude measures produced an overall diagnostic accuracy of 82\%. Pulse wave abnormalities have been observed in CFS and represent a potential objective measure to help differentiate between CFS patients and healthy controls.},

Vascular responses were extracted from cardiac (electrocardiogram, ECG) and peripheral pulse (photoplethysmography, PPG) waveforms. Wavelet analysis characterized their cardiovascular responses in healthy adult subjects in the time-frequency space, and for the ECG-PPG inter-relationship in terms of the PAT. PAT showed a characteristic biphasic response to gasp, with an increase of 59 ± 59 ms (p = 0.001) compared to the maximum value reached during quiet breathing, and a decrease of -38 ± 55 ms (p \textbackslash textless 0.01) compared to the minimum value during quiet breathing. The response measures were repeatable. This pilot study has successfully shown the feasibility of using wavelet analysis to characterize the cardiovascular waveforms and quantify their changes with DIG.},

Nailfold capillaroscopy is also commercially available, with significant published literature that supports its use for detecting microangiopathy secondary to specific connective tissue diseases in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. Infrared thermography measures skin temperature and not perfusion directly, and it has only gained acceptance for some surgical and peripheral microvascular applications. Other emerging technologies including imaging photoplethysmography, optical coherence tomography, photoacoustic tomography, hyperspectral imaging, and tissue viability imaging are also described to show their potential as techniques that could become established tools for clinical microvascular assessment.

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the application of clinical pathway simulation in machine learning, using clinical audit data, in order to identify key drivers for improving use and speed of thrombolysis at individual hospitals.Design Computer simulation modelling and machine learning.Setting Seven acute stroke units.Participants Anonymised clinical audit data for 7864 patients.Results Three factors were pivotal in governing thrombolysis use: (1) the proportion of patients with a known stroke onset time (range 44\%–73\%), (2) pathway speed (for patients arriving within 4 hours of onset: per-hospital median arrival-to-scan ranged from 11 to 56 min; median scan-to-thrombolysis ranged from 21 to 44 min) and (3) predisposition to use thrombolysis (thrombolysis use ranged from 31\% to 52\% for patients with stroke scanned with 30 min left to administer thrombolysis). A pathway simulation model could predict the potential benefit of improving individual stages of the clinical pathway speed, whereas a machine learning model could predict the benefit of exporting clinical decision making from one hospital to another, while allowing for differences in patient population between hospitals. By applying pathway simulation and machine learning together, we found a realistic ceiling of 15\%–25\% use of thrombolysis across different hospitals and, in the seven hospitals studied, a realistic opportunity to double the number of patients with no significant disability that may be attributed to thrombolysis.Conclusions National clinical audit may be enhanced by a combination of pathway simulation and machine learning, which best allows for an understanding of key levers for improvement in hyperacute stroke pathways, allowing for differences between local patient populations. These models, based on standard clinical audit data, may be applied at scale while providing results at individual hospital level. The models facilitate understanding of variation and levers for improvement in stroke pathways, and help set realistic targets tailored to local populations.},

  abstract = {Objective: Objective assessment of autonomic function is important, including the investigation of slow-paced breathing to induce associated periodic changes in the cardiovascular system – such as blood pressure and heart rate. However, pulse changes across a range of peripheral body sites have seldom been explored with this challenge. The primary aim of this pilot study was to utilize multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG) technology to quantify the phase delays, i.e., correlation lags, between changes in heart rate and changes in key pulse features with slow-paced breathing (0.1 Hz).Methods: Waveforms were collected simultaneously from the right and left ear lobes, thumbs, and great toes of 18 healthy adult subjects. Cross correlation lags between reference beat-to-beat changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) R-R wave interval and changes in pulse arrival time (foot of pulse; PATf) and also for pulse amplitude (foot-to-peak; AMP) were determined.Results: Relative to R-R changes, the median ear, thumb, and toe PATf correlation lags were 3.4, 2.9, and 2.1 beats, respectively; contrasting to AMP with 5.7, 6.0, and 6.9 beats, respectively. These PATf correlation lags in beats were significantly lower than for the AMP measure. Segmental differences between sites and timing measure variability have also been quantified.Conclusion: This pilot study has indicated bilateral similarity plus segmental differences for relative delays in PPG pulse timing and amplitude measures relative to R-R interval changes with paced breathing. These correlation and variability data are now available for comparison with cardiovascular patient groups to support development of autonomic function assessment techniques.}

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the feasibility of novel photoplethysmography (PPG) Pulse Sounder/Pulse Visualizer communication techniques for alerting the presence (or absence) of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Approach: Proof of concept evaluation using our previously published multi-site PPG pulse data set (110 participants included; age\,\,{$>$}\,\,40 years; 44\% PAD by ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI)). Two main pulse encoding rules using the risetime as an example feature to mark each heartbeat in a 6\,s analysis study window: if risetime at both great toes\,\,⩽time threshold (‘no PAD’ state) then heartbeat marked with a single 5\,kHz audio tone; if risetime from either great toe\,\,{$>$}\,\,threshold (‘PAD’) then heartbeat marked with a distinct train of 5\,kHz audio tones. A simple spectrogram visual plot was also produced for each participant’s audio signals. ROC curve analysis first determined an appropriate risetime threshold using the simple-to-evaluate PAD Visualizer and then re-tested at this level with PAD Sounder and classification performance summarized. Main results: The pulse encoding rules used were easy to learn. Visualizer best communication performance at risetime 0.27\,s gave specificity 80.6\%, sensitivity 95.8\%, accuracy 87.3\%, negative predictive value 96.2\%, and Kappa statistic of 0.75. Classification performance for blinded assessment with audio PAD Sounder was identical. Significance: Substantial agreements demonstrated between Sounder/Visualizer disease techniques and the ABPI PAD reference. These simple-to-use PAD communications methods when embedded into an appropriate device platform could offer significant benefits in PAD diagnosis for a range of clinical settings, including primary care where low-cost, portable and easy-to-use diagnostics can be desirable.},

  abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus is a common cause of bronchiolitis. Historically, point-of-care tests have involved antigen detection technology with limited sensitivity. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and model the economic impact of the Roche cobas® Liat® point-of-care influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus test.The “DEC-RSV” study was a multi-centre, prospective, observational study in children under 2 years presenting with viral respiratory symptoms. A nasopharyngeal aspirate sample was tested using the point-of-care test and standard laboratory-based procedures. The primary outcome was accuracy of respiratory syncytial virus detection. The cost implications of adopting a point-of-care test were modelled using study data.A total of 186 participants were recruited, with both tests performed on 177 samples. The point-of-care test was invalid for 16 samples (diagnostic yield 91\%) leaving 161 available for primary analysis. After resolving discrepancies, the cobas® Liat® respiratory syncytial virus test had 100.00\% (95\% CI 96.07\%–100.00\%) sensitivity and 98.53\% (95\% CI 92.08\%–99.96\%) specificity. Median time to result was 0.6\hspace{0.25em}h (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5–1) for point-of-care testing and 28.9\hspace{0.25em}h (IQR 26.3–48.1) for standard laboratory testing. Estimated non-diagnostic cost savings for 1000 patients, based on isolation decision-making on point-of-care test result, were £57{$\mkern1mu$}010, which would increase to £94{$\mkern1mu$}847 when cohort nursing is used.In young children the cobas® Liat® point-of-care respiratory syncytial virus test has high diagnostic accuracy using nasopharyngeal aspirates (currently an off-licence sample type). Time to result is clinically important and was favourable compared to laboratory-based testing. The potential exists for cost savings when adopting the point-of-care test.This prospective evaluation of the cobas Liat point-of-care RSV test in children demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy using nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, with favourable time to result compared to usual laboratory-based testing procedures https://bit.ly/2yKKmUB},

The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a more sensitive tool for PAD detection than is screening for intermittent claudication (IC); only about 10\% to 30\% of patients diagnosed with PAD based on the ABI have classic symptoms of IC. The prevalence of PAD increases markedly with older age and in persons with diabetes or a history of smoking; prevalence also is elevated in persons with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or chronic kidney disease. PAD is more prevalent in primary care medical practices than in community-dwelling populations. PAD (defined as an ABI \&lt; 0.90) is associated with a twofold to threefold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Borderline and low-normal ABI values, as well as elevated ABI values (\&gt; 1.30 or \&gt; 1.40), are increasingly recognized as being associated with elevated cardiovascular mortality. Persons with PAD have significantly increased functional impairment and elevated rates of functional decline relative to those without PAD.},

  abstract = {Background: Hysterectomy for benign indications has been associated with an increased risk for lower-urinary-tract sequela, but results have been inconclusive. We aimed to establish the risk for stress-urinary-incontinence surgery after hysterectomy for benign indications. Methods: We did a nationwide, population-based, cohort study from 1973 to 2003 in Sweden. We identified our population from the Swedish Inpatient Registry. We selected 165 260 women who had undergone hysterectomy (exposed cohort) and a control group of 479 506 individuals who had not had this procedure (unexposed cohort), matched by year of birth and county of residence. In both cohorts, occurrence of stress-urinary-incontinence surgery was established from the Swedish Inpatient Registry. Hazard ratios with 95\% CIs were calculated by Cox's proportional-hazards regression. Findings: During the 30-year observational period, the rate of stress-urinary-incontinence surgery per 100 000 person-years was 179 (95\% CI 173-186) in the exposed cohort versus 76 (73-79) in the unexposed cohort. Correspondingly, individuals in the exposed cohort were at increased risk for stress-urinary-incontinence surgery compared with those in the unexposed cohort (hazard ratio 2·4; 95\% CI 2·3-2·5), irrespective of surgical technique. Risk for stress-urinary-incontinence surgery varied slightly with time of follow-up: the highest overall risk was recorded within 5 years of surgery (2·7; 2·5-2·9) and the lowest risk was seen after an observation period of 10 years or more (2·1, 1·9-2·2). Interpretation: Hysterectomy for benign indications, irrespective of surgical technique, increases the risk for subsequent stress-urinary-incontinence surgery. Women should be counselled on associated risks related to hysterectomy, and other treatment options should be considered before surgery. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Atypical attention, while not a diagnostic feature, is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The study of these atypicalities has recently gained in both quantity and quality, due in part to an increased focus on attentional atypicalities as one of the earliest signs of ASD in infancy. A range of attentional processes and components have been investigated, and the methods used are varied, from Posner-type paradigms, to the more recent use of eye-movement recording and change-detection techniques. This methodological complexity is one factor in the production of conflicting evidence on the topic of attention in ASD. This review uses a focus on methodology to clarify the literature to date and provide a resource for researchers wishing to study attention in ASD. Other factors that have contributed to the current discrepancies in findings are discussed, particularly the role of individual and group differences within the population of people with ASD. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Many patients with restless legs syndrome (Willis-Ekbom disease) complain of burning sensations in their feet associated with the desire to move, such that they seek cooler environments. This pilot study aimed to characterise the microvascular skin changes in 12 patients with restless legs syndrome compared with 12 age- and sex-matched controls. Patients with moderate or severe restless legs syndrome and controls underwent detailed thermovascular assessment in a controlled temperature room at three different stages (normothermic phase 23 °C, hot phase 30 °C, cold phase 18 °C). Microvascular activity was recorded during all phases by bilateral great toe laser-Doppler flowmetry and also by whole-body thermography. Patient and control measurements were compared. The study protocol was well tolerated. Parameters extracted from the laser-Doppler flowmetry measurements were used to model a logistic function using binary logistic regression. This demonstrated a statistically significant difference between patients with restless legs syndrome and healthy controls (P \textbackslash textless 0.001). Visual inspection of the body thermography image sequences showed increased lower limb movement in patients with restless legs syndrome patients compared with controls. Thermography analysis also showed significant differences between foot temperatures in patients with restless legs syndrome compared with controls during the hot phase (P = 0.011). Notably, patients with restless legs syndrome had more uniform foot temperatures, whereas controls had a wider variability in surface temperature across the feet. This novel study demonstrates impaired microvascular circulation in patients with restless legs syndrome in comparison to matched controls and a potential mechanism for the sensation of burning feet. The protocol also provides an experimental paradigm to test therapeutic interventions for the future.},

Methods In 12 patients, trans-lid retinal illumination of one eye was employed during sleep to prevent the depolarisation of rods and thus reduce their metabolic activity. Techniques A headband was used to place a source of chemical light over one eye, with its fellow as a control. Measurements Colour contrast thresholds were measured before and after a period of treatment in treated eyes, and the changes were compared to those in untreated fellow eyes, and areas of 'dark retinal anomalies' (microaneurysms, dot haemorrhages) were measured at the same time points. Results Patients found this intervention to be acceptable, and no adverse effects were noted. In the majority of cases, and for each outcome measure, the treated eyes improved relative to their fellows. The intervention significantly reduced the tritan thresholds in treated eyes relative to their fellows (P ¼ 0.03), and the area of dark retinal anomalies decreased in treated eyes and increased in untreated eyes, with a similar probability. Conclusions The study showed that this intervention is safe. Although the study was not powered to study efficiacy, the results are promising and consistent with other reports that indicate the retina in DR is suffering from hypoxia; however, further trials should be undertaken.},

The secondary outcomes of change in visual acuity, achromatic contrast sensitivity, and microperimetric thresholds improved significantly in study eyes and deteriorated in fellow eyes.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: Sleeping in dim light that can keep rods light adapted may reverse the changes of DMO.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Providing renal support for small children is very challenging using the machinery currently available in the United States. As the extracorporeal volume (ECV) relative to blood volume increases and the state of critical illness worsens, the chance for instability during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) initiation also increases. CRRT machines with smaller ECV could reduce the risks and improve outcomes.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS: We present a case series of small children (n = 12) who received continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) via an Aquadex™ machine (ECV = 33 ml) with 30 ml/kg/h of prereplacement fluids at Children's of Alabama between December 2013 and April 2015. We assessed in vitro fluid precision using the adapted continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) system.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: We used 101 circuits over 261 days to provide CVVH for 12 children (median age 30 days; median weight 3.4 kg). Median CVVH duration was 14.5 days [interquartile range (IQR) = 10; 22.8 days]. Most circuits were routinely changed after 72 h. Five of 101 (5 \%) initiations were associated with mild transient change in vital signs. Complications were infrequent (three transient cases of hypothermia, three puncture-site bleedings, one systemic bleed, and one right atrial thrombus). Most patients (7/12, 58 \%) were discharged from the intensive care unit; six of them (50 \%) were discharged home.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: CRRT machines with low ECV can enable clinicians to provide adequate, timely, safe, and efficient renal support to small, critically ill infants.},

  abstract = {The Circle Hough Transform (CHT) has become a common method for circle detection in numerous image processing applications. Various modifications to the basic CHT operation have been suggested which include: the inclusion of edge orientation, simultaneous consideration of a range of circle radii, use of a complex accumulator array with the phase proportional to the log of radius, and the implementation of the CHT as filter operations. However, there has also been much work recently on the definition and use of invariance filters for object detection including circles. The contribution of the work presented here is to show that a specific combination of modifications to the CHT is formally equivalent to applying a scale invariant kernel operator. This work brings together these two themes in image processing which have herewith been quite separate. Performance results for applying various forms of CHT filters incorporating some or all of the available modifications, along with results from the invariance kernel, are included. These are in terms of an analysis of the peak width in the output detection array (with and without the presence of noise), and also an analysis of the peak position in terms of increasing noise levels. The results support the equivalence between the specific form of the CHT developed in this work and the invariance kernel.},

The current study was designed to investigate this hypothesis. Participants with and without ASD completed two scene perception tasks: a simple “spot the difference” task, where they had to say which one of a pair of pictures had a detail missing, and a complex “which one's weird” task, where they had to decide which one of a pair of pictures looks “weird”. Participants with ASD did not differ from TD participants in their ability to accurately identify the target picture in both tasks. However, analysis of the eye movement sequences showed that participants with ASD viewed scenes differently from normal controls exclusively for the complex task. This difference in eye movement patterns, and the method used to examine different patterns, adds to the knowledge base regarding eye movements and ASD. Our results are in accordance with Minshew and Goldstein's theory that complex, but not simple, information processing is impaired in ASD.},

I examined the adequacy of reporting and whether appropriate statistical methods were used. METHODS: I examined 60 articles published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery, European Journal of Cardio-thoracic Surgery, Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery, and the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2006. RESULTS: Thirty-one of the 60 studies did not provide adequate information on how the propensity score-matched pairs were formed. Eleven (18\%) of studies did not report on whether matching on the propensity score balanced baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects in the matched sample. No studies used appropriate methods to compare baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects in the propensity score-matched sample. Eight (13\%) of the 60 studies explicitly used statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of matched data when estimating the effect of treatment on the outcomes. Two studies used appropriate methods for some outcomes, but not for all outcomes. Thirty-nine (65\%) studies explicitly used statistical methods that were inappropriate for matched-pairs data when estimating the effect of treatment on outcomes. Eleven studies did not report the statistical tests that were used to assess the statistical significance of the treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of propensity score-matched samples tended to be poor in the cardiovascular surgery literature. Most statistical analyses ignored the matched nature of the sample. I provide suggestions for improving the reporting and analysis of studies that use propensity score matching.},

  abstract = {Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to reduce the impact of treatment-selection bias when estimating causal treatment effects using observational data. Several propensity-score matching methods are currently employed in the medical literature: matching on the logit of the propensity score using calipers of width either 0.2 or 0.6 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score; matching on the propensity score using calipers of 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.1; and 5 –\textbackslash textgreater 1 digit matching on the propensity score. We conducted empirical investigations and Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the relative performance of these competing methods. Using a large sample of patients hospitalized with a heart attack and with exposure being receipt of a statin prescription at hospital discharge, we found that the 8 different methods produced propensity-score matched samples in which qualitatively equivalent balance in measured baseline variables was achieved between treated and untreated subjects. Seven of the 8 propensity-score matched samples resulted in qualitatively similar estimates of the reduction in mortality due to statin exposure. 5 –\textbackslash textgreater 1 digit matching resulted in a qualitatively different estimate of relative risk reduction compared to the other 7 methods. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that matching using calipers of width of 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score and the use of calipers of width 0.02 and 0.03 tended to have superior performance for estimating treatment effects.},

We sought to determine whether the results correlate with the outcome. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 115 consecutive cadaveric lung transplants (single lung: 42; bilateral lung: 63; heart–lung: 10) performed over 4 years. Results: Fifty-three (46\%) grafts had positive BAL (bacteria: 33; fungus: 10; mixed: 10) and 62 (54\%) were negative. Recipients with donor BAL culture positive for bacteria had lower mean oxygenation index in the first 6 h compared with those with negative bacterial culture (36.5±14.73 vs. 44.1±16.79 kPa) (P=0.019). They also had longer median intensive treatment unit stay (2.5 vs. 1.5 days) (P=0.035), and median time of mechanical ventilation (37.5 vs. 23.0 h) (P=0.008), as well as inferior 6-month, 1-year, 2-year and 4-year cumulative survival (79, 77, 74, 60\% vs. 93, 92, 88, 79\% respectively) (P=0.04). There was no difference in the above parameters between recipients with Gram-negative (n=18) and recipients with Gram-positive bacteria (n=19) in the donor BAL. Incidence of acute rejection within the first 2 weeks and time of onset of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) were similar in the bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative groups. Recipients with donor BAL positive for fungi alone had similar outcome with the negatives. There was no difference in the donor oxygenation index and age, recipient age, transplant type and ischaemic time between compared groups. There was a significant difference in the median length of donor mechanical ventilation between donors with Gram-positive and donors with Gram-negative bacteria in the BAL (24 vs. 48 h) (P=0.01), as well as between donors with fungi alone in the BAL and donors with negative BAL (67 vs. 48 h) (P=0.04). Conclusions: Donor lungs with lower airways colonized with bacteria result in inferior recipient outcome. Bacterial colonization of the donor lower airways could therefore be used as a marker of donor lung injury, but evidence from a prospective study is necessary.},

  abstract = {The most common method of clinical measurement of arterial blood pressure is by means of the cuff sphygmomanometer. This instrument has provided fundamental quantitative information on arterial pressure in individual subjects and in populations and facilitated estimation of cardiovascular risk related to levels of blood pressure obtained from the brachial cuff. Although the measurement is taken in a peripheral limb, the values are generally assumed to reflect the pressure throughout the arterial tree in large conduit arteries. Since the arterial pressure pulse becomes modified as it travels away from the heart towards the periphery, this is generally true for mean and diastolic pressure, but not for systolic pressure, and so pulse pressure. The relationship between central and peripheral pulse pressure depends on propagation characteristics of arteries. Hence, while the sphygmomanometer gives values of two single points on the pressure wave (systolic and diastolic pressure), there is additional information that can be obtained from the time-varying pulse waveform that enables an improved quantification of the systolic load on the heart and other central organs. This topical review will assess techniques of pressure measurement that relate to the use of the cuff sphygmomanometer and to the non-invasive registration and analysis of the peripheral and central arterial pressure waveform. Improved assessment of cardiovascular function in relation to treatment and management of high blood pressure will result from future developments in the indirect measurement of arterial blood pressure that involve the conventional cuff sphygmomanometer with the addition of information derived from the peripheral arterial pulse.},

  abstract = {AIMS: An increased risk of stroke was observed in two atrial fibrillation (AF) trials of oral factor Xa inhibitors, when patients were transitioned to open label warfarin at the end of the study. The objective of this study is to determine whether initiation of warfarin is associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients with AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a nested case-control analysis was conducted within a cohort of 70 766 patients with AF between 1993 and 2008. Stroke cases were randomly matched with up to 10 controls on age, sex, date of AF diagnosis, and time since AF diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of stroke associated with current warfarin use classified according to time since initiation of treatment (\textbackslash textless30 days, 31-90 days, and \textbackslash textgreater90 days), when compared with non-use. A total of 5519 patients experienced a stroke during follow-up. Warfarin was associated with a 71\% increased risk of stroke in the first 30 days of use (RR: 1.71, 95\% CI: 1.39-2.12), while decreased risks were observed with initiation \textbackslash textgreater30 days before the event (31-90 days: RR: 0.50, 95\% CI: 0.34-0.75 and \textbackslash textgreater90 days: RR: 0.55, 95\% CI: 0.50-0.61, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients initiating warfarin may be at an increased risk of stroke during the first 30 days of treatment, supporting the biological plausibility of a transient hypercoagulable state at the start of the treatment, although additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {Background. The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative Group has published a consensus definition/classification system for acute kidney injury (AKI) termed the RIFLE criteria. The Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) group has recently proposed modifications to this system. It is currently unknown whether there are advantages between these criteria. Methods. We interrogated the Australian New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database (APD) for all adult admissions to 57 ICUs from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2005. We compared the performance of the RIFLE and AKIN criteria for diagnosis and classification of AKI and for robustness of hospital mortality. Results. We included 120~123 critically ill patients, of which 27.8\% had a primary diagnosis of sepsis. We found only small differences (\&lt;1\%) in the number of patients classified as having some degree of kidney injury using either the AKIN or RIFLE definition or classification systems. AKIN slightly increased the number of patients classified as Stage I injury (category R in RIFLE) (from 16.2 to 18.1\%) but decreased the number of patients classified as having Stage II injury (category I in RIFLE) (13.6\% versus 10.1\%). The area under the ROC curve for hospital mortality was 0.66 for RIFLE and 0.67 for AKIN in all patients and it was 0.65 for both in septic patients. Conclusion. Compared to the RIFLE criteria, the AKIN criteria do not materially improve the sensitivity, robustness and predictive ability of the definition and classification of AKI in the first 24 h after admission to ICU.},

  abstract = {Background. The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative Working Group recently developed the RIFLE criteria, a consensus definition for acute kidney injury (AKI). We sought to evaluate the RIFLE criteria on the day of ICU admission in a large heterogenous population of critically ill patients. Methods. Retrospective interrogation of prospectively collected data from the Australian New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database. We evaluated 120\,123 patients admitted for ≥24 h from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2005 from 57 ICUs across Australia. Results. The median (IQR) age was 64.3 (50.8–75.4) years, 59.5\% were male, 28.6\% had co-morbid disease, 50.3\% were medical admissions and the initial mean (±SD) APACHEII score was 16.9 (±7.7). According to the RIFLE criteria, on the day of admission, AKI occurred in 36.1\%, with a maximum RIFLE category of Risk in 16.3\%, Injury in 13.6\%, and Failure 6.3\%. AKI, defined by any RIFLE category, was associated with an increase in hospital mortality (OR 3.29, 95\% CI 3.19–3.41, P \&lt; 0.0001). The crude hospital mortality stratified by RIFLE category was 17.9\% for Risk, 27.7\% for Injury and 33.2\% for Failure. By multivariable analysis, each RIFLE category was independently associated with hospital mortality (OR: Risk 1.58, Injury 2.54 and Failure 3.22). Conclusion. In a large heterogenous cohort of critically ill patients, the RIFLE criteria classified \&gt;36\% with AKI on the day of admission. For successive increases in severity of RIFLE category, there were increases in hospital mortality. The RIFLE criteria represent a simple tool for the detection and classification of AKI and for correlation with clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background. The RIFLE classification scheme for acute kidney injury (AKI) is based on relative changes in serum creatinine (SCr) and on urine output. The SCr criteria, therefore, require a pre-morbid baseline value. When unknown, current recommendations are to estimate a baseline SCr by the MDRD equation. However, the MDRD approach assumes a glomerular filtration rate of ∼75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . This method has not been validated. Methods. Data from the Beginning and Ending Supportive Therapy for the Kidney (BEST Kidney) study, a prospective observational study from 54 ICUs in 23 countries of critically ill patients with severe AKI, were analysed. The RIFLE class was determined by using observed (o) pre-morbid and estimated (e) baseline SCr values. Agreement was evaluated by correlation coefficients and Bland–Altman plots. Sensitivity analysis by chronic kidney disease (CKD) status was performed. Results. Seventy-six percent of patients ( n = 1327) had a pre-morbid baseline SCr, and 1314 had complete data for evaluation. Forty-six percent had CKD. The median (IQR) values were 97 μmol/L (79–150) for oSCr and 88 μmol/L (71–97) for eSCr. The oSCr and eSCr determined at ICU admission and at study enrolment showed only a modest correlation ( r = 0.49, r = 0.39). At ICU admission and study enrolment, eSCr misclassified 18.8\% and 11.7\% of patients as having AKI compared with oSCr. Exclusion of CKD patients improved the correlation between oSCr and eSCr at ICU admission and study enrolment ( r = 0.90, r = 0.84) resulting in 6.6\% and 4.0\% being misclassified, respectively. Conclusions. While limited, estimating baseline SCr by the MDRD equation when pre-morbid SCr is unavailable would appear to perform reasonably well for determining the RIFLE categories only if and when pre-morbid GFR was near normal. However, in patients with suspected CKD, the use of MDRD to estimate baseline SCr overestimates the incidence of AKI and should not likely be used. Improved methods to estimate baseline SCr are needed.},

In Germany, the largest cohort of patients studied to date has been treated using a percutaneous, catheter-based approach. We report the acute outcomes of patients enrolled in the investigator-initiated German transcatheter mitral valve interventions (TRAMI) registry. Methods and results Between January 2009 and August 2011, 486 patients [median age 75 (interquartile range 70?80) years; 200 women (41\%)] were enrolled in the registry (309 retrospectively and 177 prospectively), with 481 patients (99\%) having undergone percutaneous edge-to-edge therapy for MR using the MitraClip. At baseline, 93\% of patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV and 71\% of patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤50\%. Two-thirds of patients presented with functional MR. Procedural success was achieved in 94\% of patients, with grade III present in 93\% of patients at baseline yet only 6\% post-intervention. Retrospective patients were followed for a median of 183 days, prospective patients for a median of 44 days. The periprocedural complication rate was low, with only minor bleedings as the most significant event. In-hospital and post-discharge mortality was 2.5\% and 12.5\%, respectively. Conclusions Data from the German TRAMI registry suggest that MitraClip therapy is a viable treatment option in daily clinical routine for high surgical risk patients with significant MR.},

  abstract = {Abstract Purpose To compare probabilistic and deterministic algorithms for linking mothers and infants within electronic health records (EHRs) to support pregnancy outcomes research. Methods The study population was women enrolled in Group Health (Washington State, USA) delivering a liveborn infant from 2001 through 2008 (N?=?33?093 deliveries) and infant members born in these years. We linked women to infants by surname, address, and dates of birth and delivery using deterministic and probabilistic algorithms. In a subset previously linked using ?gold standard? identifiers (N?=?14?449), we assessed each approach's sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). For deliveries with no ?gold standard? linkage (N?=?18?644), we compared the algorithms' linkage proportions. We repeated our analyses in an independent test set of deliveries from 2009 through 2013. We reviewed medical records to validate a sample of pairs apparently linked by one algorithm but not the other (N?=?51 or 1.4\% of discordant pairs). Results In the 2001?2008 ?gold standard? population, the probabilistic algorithm's sensitivity was 84.1\% (95\% CI, 83.5?84.7) and PPV 99.3\% (99.1?99.4), while the deterministic algorithm had sensitivity 74.5\% (73.8?75.2) and PPV 95.7\% (95.4?96.0). In the test set, the probabilistic algorithm again had higher sensitivity and PPV. For deliveries in 2001?2008 with no ?gold standard? linkage, the probabilistic algorithm found matched infants for 58.3\% and the deterministic algorithm, 52.8\%. On medical record review, 100\% of linked pairs appeared valid. Conclusions A probabilistic algorithm improved linkage proportion and accuracy compared to a deterministic algorithm. Better linkage methods can increase the value of EHRs for pregnancy outcomes research. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A new framework is offered that uses multilevel logistic regression (MLR) to analyze data from 'visual world' eyetracking experiments used in psycholinguistic research. The MLR framework overcomes some of the problems with conventional analyses, making it possible to incorporate time as a continuous variable and gaze location as a categorical dependent variable. The multilevel approach minimizes the need for data aggregation and thus provides a more statistically powerful approach. With MLR, the researcher builds a mathematical model of the overall response curve that separates the response into different temporal components. The researcher can test hypotheses by examining the impact of independent variables and their interactions on these components. A worked example using MLR is provided. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The median length of hospitalization was 6?days for UF, 4?days for UC, and 6?days for UN. All-cause 30-day readmissions tended to be fewer in the UF (16\%) compared with the UN (24\%) or UC (24\%) groups. All groups lost weight, although to a greater extent in the UF group (15.8 lb vs 6.3 lb in UC and 4.7 lb in UN). Concomitantly, UF manifested the greatest increase in serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, and the number of patients with creatinine increases of {$>$}0.5?mg/dL (44\% vs 24\% in UC and 20\% in UN). In acute decompensated heart failure, UF appears to be more effective for volume removal and possibly prevention of all-cause hospital readmission to 30?days than UC or UN. These findings, as well as the effects on renal function and length of stay, need to be further evaluated in a prospective randomized study.},

Identifying and quantifying dynamical networks of diverse systems with different types of interactions is a challenge. Here we develop a framework to probe interactions among diverse systems, and we identify a physiological network. We find that each physiological state is characterized by a specific network structure, demonstrating a robust interplay between network topology and function. Across physiological states, the network undergoes topological transitions associated with fast reorganization of physiological interactions on time scales of a few minutes, indicating high network flexibility in response to perturbations.

The implications of this for sample sizes for remodeling studies in heart failure (HF) have not been elucidated. We determined the reproducibility of CMR in HF and calculated the sample size requirements and compared them with published values for echocardiography. Breathhold gradient echo cines of the left ventricle were acquired in 20 patients with HF and 20 normal subjects. Sample size values were calculated from the interstudy standard deviation of the difference. The percentage variability of the measured parameters in our HF group of intraobserver (2.0-7.4\%), interobserver (3.3-7.7\%), and interstudy (2.5-4.8\%) measurements was slightly larger than for our normal group (1.6-6.6\%, 1.6-7.3\%, and 2.0-7.3\%, respectively) but remained comparable with previous studies in normal subjects. The calculated sample sizes in patients with HF for CMR to detect a 10-ml change in end-diastolic volume (n = 12) and end-systolic volume (n = 10), a 3\% change in ejection fraction (n = 15), and a 10-g change in mass was (n = 9) were substantially smaller than recently published values for two-dimensional echocardiography (reduction of 81-97\%). Breathhold CMR is a fast comprehensive technique for the assessment of cardiac volumes, function, and mass in HF that is accurate but also highly reproducible. This allows a considerable reduction in the patient numbers required to prove a hypothesis in research studies, which suggests a potential for important research cost savings.},

  abstract = {In the biologic laboratory we have a method of procedure for determining the effect of an agent or process that may be considered typical. It consists in dividing a group of animals into two cohorts, one considered the “experimental group,” the other the “control.” On the experimental group some variable is brought to play; the control is left alone. The results are set up as in table 1-a. If the results show that the ratio a:a + b is different from the ratio c:c + d, it is considered demonstrated that the process brought to bear on the experimental group has had a significant effect. A similar method is prevalent in statistical practice, which I venture to think has come into authority because of its apparent equivalence to the experimental procedure. In Biometrika it is referred to as the fourfold table and it is used as a paradigm of statistical analysis. The usual arrangement is that given in table 1-b. The entries, a, b, c and d are manipulated arithmetically to determine whether there is any correlation between A and B. A considerable number of indices have been elaborated to measure this correlation. Pearson has given the formula for calculating the product-moment correlation coefficient from a fourfold table on the assumption that the distribution of both variates is normal; Yule has an index of association for the fourfold table; there are the chi-square test and others. In essence, however, all these indices measure in different ways whether and how much, in comparison with the variation of random sampling, the ratio a:a + b differs from the ratio c:c + d. If the difference departs significantly from zero, there is said to be correlation, and the correlation is the greater the greater the difference.},

The development of vascular networks within densely populated and metabolically functional tissues facilitate transport of nutrients and removal of waste products, thus preserving cellular viability over a long period of time. Despite tremendous progress in fabricating complex tissue constructs in the past few years, approaches for controlled vascularization within hydrogel based engineered tissue constructs have remained limited. Here, we report a three dimensional (3D) micromolding technique utilizing bioprinted agarose template fibers to fabricate microchannel networks with various architectural features within photocrosslinkable hydrogel constructs. Using the proposed approach, we were able to successfully embed functional and perfusable microchannels inside methacrylated gelatin (GelMA), star poly(ethylene glycol-co-lactide) acrylate (SPELA), poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels at different concentrations. In particular, GelMA hydrogels were used as a model to demonstrate the functionality of the fabricated vascular networks in improving mass transport, cellular viability and differentiation within the cell-laden tissue constructs. In addition, successful formation of endothelial monolayers within the fabricated channels was confirmed. Overall, our proposed strategy represents an effective technique for vascularization of hydrogel constructs with useful applications in tissue engineering and organs on a chip.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study aimed at assessing the feasibility and long-term efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in a ?real world? setting. Background Although LAAO has recently emerged as an alternative to oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation for the prevention of thromboembolic stroke, ?real world? data about the procedure with different devices are lacking. Methods Eight centers in the United Kingdom contributed to a retrospective registry for LAAO procedures undertaken between July 2009 and November 2014. Results A total of 371 patients (72.9?±?8.3 years old, 88.9\% males) were enrolled. The overall procedure success was 92.5\%, with major events in 3.5\% of cases. The device choice was Watchman in 63\% of cases, Amplatzer Cardiac Plug in 34.7\%, Lariat in 1.7\%, and Coherex WaveCrest in 0.6\%. A significant improvement in procedure success (from 89.2\% to 95.7\%; P?=?0.018) and reduction of acute major complications (from 6.5\% to 0.5\%; P?=?0.001) were observed between procedures in the first and the second half of the recruitment time. An annual 90.1\% relative risk reduction (RRR) for ischemic stroke, an 87.2\% thromboembolic events RRR, and a 92.9\% major bleeding RRR were observed, if compared with the predicted annual risks based on CHADS2, CHA2DS2-Vasc, and HAS-BLED scores, respectively, over a follow-up period of 24.7?±?16.07 months. Conclusions LAAO can be performed safely in a real world setting with good implant success rates and procedural outcomes. The long-term benefits of the procedure are reassuring in terms of both ischemic events and avoidance of severe bleeding associated with anticoagulation in this patient group. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Patients with severe resistant hypertension were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to undergo renal denervation or a sham procedure. Before randomization, patients were receiving a stable antihypertensive regimen involving maximally tolerated doses of at least three drugs, including a diuretic. The primary efficacy end point was the change in office systolic blood pressure at 6 months; a secondary efficacy end point was the change in mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure. The primary safety end point was a composite of death, end-stage renal disease, embolic events resulting in end-organ damage, renovascular complications, or hypertensive crisis at 1 month or new renal-artery stenosis of more than 70\% at 6 months.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: A total of 535 patients underwent randomization.

Sinonasal symptom improvement was assessed using the validated 20-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20) survey. Standardized effect sizes were computed to further assess clinical significance. Ostial patency rate, rhinosinusitis episode frequency, impact of sinus disease on activity and work productivity using the validated Work Productivity and Activity Impairment survey, complications, and revision rate were also compared between the two groups.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: Ninety-two patients (50 balloon dilation; 42 FESS) were treated and 89 (96.7\%) completed 1-year follow-up. Both groups showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p \textbackslash textless 0.0001) improvement in mean overall SNOT-20 scores and in all four SNOT-20 subscales. The 1-year mean change in SNOT-20 after balloon dilation (-1.64) was noninferior to FESS (-1.65; p \textbackslash textless 0.001). The standardized effect size was large, showing clinically significant improvement for both interventions. Ostial patency was 96.7 and 98.7\% after balloon dilation and FESS, respectively, and each group reported significant reductions (p \textbackslash textless 0.0001) in rhinosinusitis episodes (mean decrease, 4.2 for balloon dilation and 3.5 for FESS). Overall work productivity and daily activity impairment due to chronic sinusitis were significantly improved (p \textbackslash textless 0.001) in both groups. There were no complications and revision surgery rate was 2\% in each arm through 1 year.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSION: With 1-year follow-up, standalone balloon dilation is as effective as FESS in the treatment of CRS in patients with maxillary sinus disease with or without anterior ethmoid disease who failed medical therapy and met the criteria for medically necessary FESS.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine the size, shape and distribution of single human motor units in-vivo in healthy controls of different ages. Methods A novel diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique was used in combination with in-scanner electrical stimulation to quantify the shape, cross-sectional area, and dimensions of individual motor units in 10 healthy subjects. Results Thirty-one discrete motor units were studied. The majority were elliptical or crescent shaped, but occasional split motor units were observed. The mean motor unit cross sectional area was 26.7~±~11.2~mm2, the mean maximum dimension was 10.7~±~3.3~mm, and the mean minimum dimension was 4.5~±~1.2~mm. Subjects aged over 40 had significantly larger maximum dimensions than those below this age (p~{$<~$}0.05). Conclusions Motor unit MRI (MUMRI) is a novel technique capable of revealing the size, shape and position of multiple motor units in human muscles. It is reproducible, non-invasive, and sufficiently sensitive to detect physiologically relevant changes in motor unit morphology with age. Significance To our knowledge, these results provide the first imaging assessment of human motor unit morphology. The technique shows promise both as a diagnostic tool and as a biomarker in longitudinal studies of disease progression.},

Design Cross sectional survey, with interviews with database custodians and search of electronic bibliographic database (PubMed). Studies reviewed 105 clinical databases across the United Kingdom. Results Clinical databases existed in all areas of health care, but their distribution was uneven—cancer and surgery were better covered than mental health and obstetrics. They varied greatly in age, size, growth rate, and geographical areas covered. Their scope (and thus their potential uses) and the quality of the data collected also varied. The latter was not associated with any organisational characteristics. Despite impressive achievements, many faced substantial financial uncertainty. Considerable scope existed for improvements: greater use of nationally approved codes; more support from relevant professional organisations; greater involvement by nurses, allied health professionals, managers, and laypeople in database management teams; and more attention to data security and ensuring patient confidentiality. With some notable exceptions, the audit and research potential of most databases had not been realised: half the databases had each produced only four or fewer peer reviewed research articles. Conclusions At least one clinical database support unit is needed in the United Kingdom to provide assistance in organisation and management, information technology, epidemiology, and statistics. Without such an initiative, the variable picture of databases reported here is likely to persist and their potential not be realised.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Real science has the potential to not only amaze, but also transform the way one thinks of the world and oneself. This is because the process of science is little different from the deeply resonant, natural processes of play. Play enables humans (and other mammals) to discover (and create) relationships and patterns. When one adds rules to play, a game is created. THIS IS SCIENCE: the process of playing with rules that enables one to reveal previously unseen patterns of relationships that extend our collective understanding of nature and human nature. When thought of in this way, science education becomes a more enlightened and intuitive process of asking questions and devising games to address those questions. But, because the outcome of all game-playing is unpredictable, supporting this 'messyness', which is the engine of science, is critical to good science education (and indeed creative education generally). Indeed, we have learned that doing 'real' science in public spaces can stimulate tremendous interest in children and adults in understanding the processes by which we make sense of the world. The present study (on the vision of bumble-bees) goes even further, since it was not only performed outside my laboratory (in a Norman church in the southwest of England), but the 'games' were themselves devised in collaboration with 25 8- to 10-year-old children. They asked the questions, hypothesized the answers, designed the games (in other words, the experiments) to test these hypotheses and analysed the data. They also drew the figures (in coloured pencil) and wrote the paper. Their headteacher (Dave Strudwick) and I devised the educational programme (we call 'i,scientist'), and I trained the bees and transcribed the childrens' words into text (which was done with smaller groups of children at the school's local village pub). So what follows is a novel study (scientifically and conceptually) in 'kids speak' without references to past literature, which is a challenge. Although the historical context of any study is of course important, including references in this instance would be disingenuous for two reasons. First, given the way scientific data are naturally reported, the relevant information is simply inaccessible to the literate ability of 8- to 10-year-old children, and second, the true motivation for any scientific study (at least one of integrity) is one's own curiousity, which for the children was not inspired by the scientific literature, but their own observations of the world. This lack of historical, scientific context does not diminish the resulting data, scientific methodology or merit of the discovery for the scientific and 'non-scientific' audience. On the contrary, it reveals science in its truest (most naive) form, and in this way makes explicit the commonality between science, art and indeed all creative activities. PRINCIPAL FINDING: 'We discovered that bumble-bees can use a combination of colour and spatial relationships in deciding which colour of flower to forage from. We also discovered that science is cool and fun because you get to do stuff that no one has ever done before. (Children from Blackawton)'.},

For example, the table shows survival times of 51 adult patients with recurrent malignant gliomas1 tabulated by type of tumour and indicating whether the patient had died or was still alive at analysis—that is, their survival time was censored.2 As the figure shows, the survival curves differ, but is this sufficient to conclude that in the population patients with anaplastic astrocytoma have worse survival than patients with glioblastoma? View this table: [in this window] [in a new window] Weeks to death or censoring in 51 adults with recurrent gliomas1 (A=astrocytoma, G=glioblastoma) View larger version (20K): [in this window] [in a new window] Survival curves for women with glioma by diagnosis We could compute survival curves3 for each group and compare the proportions surviving at any specific time. The weakness of this approach is that it does not provide a comparison of the total survival experience of the two groups, but rather gives a comparison at some arbitrary time point(s). In the figure the difference in survival is greater at some times than others and eventually becomes zero. We describe here the logrank test, the most popular method of comparing the survival of groups, which takes the whole follow up period into account. It has the considerable advantage that it does not require us to know anything about the shape of the survival curve or the distribution of survival times. The logrank test is used to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the populations in the probability of an event (here a death) at any time point. The analysis is based on the times of events (here deaths). For each such time we calculate the observed number of deaths in each group and the number expected if there were in reality no difference between the groups. The first death was in week 6, when one patient in group 1 died. At the start of this week, there were 51 subjects alive in total, so the risk of death in this week was 1/51. There were 20 patients in group 1, so, if the null hypothesis were true, the expected number of deaths in group 1 is 20 x 1/51 = 0.39. Likewise, in group 2 the expected number of deaths is 31 x 1/51 = 0.61. The second event occurred in week 10, when there were two deaths. There were now 19 and 31 patients at risk (alive) in the two groups, one having died in week 6, so the probability of death in week 10 was 2/50. The expected numbers of deaths were 19 x 2/50 = 0.76 and 31 x 2/50 = 1.24 respectively. The same calculations are performed each time an event occurs. If a survival time is censored, that individual is considered to be at risk of dying in the week of the censoring but not in subsequent weeks. This way of handling censored observations is the same as for the Kaplan-Meier survival curve.3 From the calculations for each time of death, the total numbers of expected deaths were 22.48 in group 1 and 19.52 in group 2, and the observed numbers of deaths were 14 and 28. We can now use a \{chi\}2 test of the null hypothesis. The test statistic is the sum of (O - E)2/E for each group, where O and E are the totals of the observed and expected events. Here (14 - 22.48)2 / 22.48 + (28 - 19.52)2 / 19.52 = 6.88. The degrees of freedom are the number of groups minus one, i.e. 2 - 1 = 1. From a table of the \{chi\}2 distribution we get P \textbackslash textless 0.01, so that the difference between the groups is statistically significant. There is a different method of calculating the test statistic,4 but we prefer this approach as it extends easily to several groups. It is also possible to test for a trend in survival across ordered groups.4 Although we have shown how the calculation is made, we strongly recommend the use of statistical software. The logrank test is based on the same assumptions as the Kaplan Meier survival curve3—namely, that censoring is unrelated to prognosis, the survival probabilities are the same for subjects recruited early and late in the study, and the events happened at the times specified. Deviations from these assumptions matter most if they are satisfied differently in the groups being compared, for example if censoring is more likely in one group than another. The logrank test is most likely to detect a difference between groups when the risk of an event is consistently greater for one group than another. It is unlikely to detect a difference when survival curves cross, as can happen when comparing a medical with a surgical intervention. When analysing survival data, the survival curves should always be plotted. Because the logrank test is purely a test of significance it cannot provide an estimate of the size of the difference between the groups or a confidence interval. For these we must make some assumptions about the data. Common methods use the hazard ratio, including the Cox proportional hazards model, which we shall describe in a future Statistics Note.

  abstract = {We evaluated the performance of CSF biomarkers for predicting risk of clinical decline and conversion to dementia in non-demented patients with cognitive symptoms. CSF samples from patients in two multicentre longitudinal studies (ADNI, n\,=\,619; BioFINDER, n\,=\,431) were analysed. Aβ(1–42), tTau and pTau CSF concentrations were measured using Elecsys CSF immunoassays, and tTau/Aβ(1–42) and pTau/Aβ(1–42) ratios calculated. Patients were classified as biomarker (BM)-positive or BM-negative at baseline. Ability of biomarkers to predict risk of clinical decline and conversion to AD/dementia was assessed using pre-established cut-offs for Aβ(1–42) and ratios; tTau and pTau cut-offs were determined. BM-positive patients showed greater clinical decline than BM-negative patients, demonstrated by greater decreases in MMSE scores (all biomarkers: –2.10 to –0.70). Risk of conversion to AD/dementia was higher in BM-positive patients (HR: 1.67~to~11.48). Performance of Tau/Aβ(1–42) ratios was superior to single biomarkers, and consistent even when using cut-offs derived in a different cohort. Optimal pTau and tTau cut-offs were approximately 27\,pg/mL and 300\,pg/mL in both BioFINDER and ADNI. Elecsys pTau/Aβ(1–42) and tTau/Aβ(1–42) are robust biomarkers for predicting risk of clinical decline and conversion to dementia in non-demented patients, and may support AD diagnosis in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Contrast agents are widely used in imaging, but until recently they had little place in ultrasonography. This has changed with the introduction of microbubbles—small (typically 3 μm in diameter) gas filled bubbles that are usually injected intravenously. Injecting a gas into the circulation may seem potentially hazardous, but extensive clinical experience has shown that the tiny volume of air or gas given (under 200 μl) is not dangerous, and the safety of microbubbles compares well to that of conventional agents in radiography and magnetic resonance imaging.1 Although microbubbles were originally designed simply to improve conventional ultrasound scanning, recent discoveries have opened up powerful emerging applications. This article describes some of these applications in radiology and cardiology and discusses the potential of microbubbles for therapy. We prepared this review from contributions from researchers with special knowledge of the use of microbubbles in radiology, cardiology, and treatment. We combined our personal experience in research over several years with a review of recent literature on the subject. Microbubbles work by resonating in an ultrasound beam, rapidly contracting and expanding in response to the pressure changes of the sound wave. By a fortunate coincidence, they vibrate particularly strongly at the high frequencies used for diagnostic ultrasound imaging. This makes them several thousand times more reflective than normal body tissues. In this way they enhance both grey scale images and flow mediated Doppler signals. As well as being useful in itself, the resonance that microbubbles produce has several special properties that can be exploited to improve diagnoses. Just as with a musical instrument, multiple harmonic signals—or overtones—are produced. Ultrasound scanners can be tuned to “listen” to these harmonics, producing strong preferential imaging of the microbubbles in an image. The selective excitation produced can also destroy microbubbles relatively easily, an effect that can be useful …},

  abstract = {Aims \hspace{1em}Left atrial appendage closure is a non-pharmacological alternative for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The objective of the multicentre EWOLUTION registry was to obtain clinical data on procedural success and complications, and long-term patient outcomes, including bleeding and incidence of stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Here, we report on the peri-procedural outcomes of up to 30 days. Methods and results \hspace{1em}Baseline/implant data are available for 1021 subjects. Subjects in the study were at high risk of stroke (average CHADS 2 score: 2.8 ± 1.3, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc: 4.5 ± 1.6) and moderate-to-high risk of bleeding (average HAS-BLED score: 2.3 ± 1.2). Almost half of the subjects (45.4\%) had a history of TIA, ischaemic stroke, or haemorrhagic stroke; 62\% of patients were deemed unsuitable for novel oral anticoagulant by their physician. The device was successfully deployed in 98.5\% of patients with no flow or minimal residual flow achieved in 99.3\% of implanted patients. Twenty-eight subjects experienced 31 serious adverse events (SAEs) within 1 day of the procedure. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.7\%. The most common SAE occurring within 30 days of the procedure was major bleeding requiring transfusion. Incidence of SAEs within 30 days was significantly lower for subjects deemed to be ineligible for oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) compared with those eligible for OAT (6.5 vs. 10.2\%, P = 0.042). Conclusion \hspace{1em}Left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device has a high success rate in complete LAAC with low peri-procedural risk, even in a population with a higher risk of stroke and bleeding, and multiple co-morbidities. Improvement in implantation techniques has led to a reduction of peri-procedural complications previously limiting the net clinical benefit of the procedure.},

  abstract = {Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia is associated with the accumulation of remnant lipoproteins and premature cardiovascular disease. Identification of dysbetalipoproteinemia is important because family members may be affected. Diagnostic testing involves demonstration of β-lipoprotein in the VLDL fraction or characterization of apo E3. These investigations are complex and relatively expensive. The ratios of apo B to total cholesterol and triglycerides have been proposed as screening tests. However, the ratio of non-HDL cholesterol to apo B (NHDLC/apoB) could offer improved performance as the confounding effect of variations in HDL cholesterol is removed.We evaluated NHDLC/apoB as a screening test for dysbetalipoproteinemia, using β-quantification analysis as a reference standard. Data from 1637 patients referred over a 16-year period for β quantification were reviewed retrospectively. In 63 patients, diagnostic criteria for dysbetalipoproteinemia (VLDL cholesterol/triglyceride ratio ≥0.69 and presence of β-VLDL) were fulfilled, and 1574 patients had dysbetalipoproteinemia excluded.Mean NHDLC/apoB in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia was 7.3 mmol/g (SD, 1.5 mmol/g) and with dysbetalipoproteinemia excluded was 4.0 mmol/g (SD, 0.5 mmol/g). The optimum cutoff of  \&gt;4.91 mmol/g achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 96.8 \% (95 \% CI, 89.0–99.6) and specificity of 95.0 \% (95 \% CI, 93.8–96.0). NHDLC/apoB offered improved performance compared to total cholesterol/apoB [diagnostic sensitivity 92.1 \% (95 \% CI, 82.4–97.4) and specificity 94.5 \% (95 \% CI, 93.2–95.6) with a cutoff of  \&gt;6.55 mmol/g]. NHDL/apoB reference ranges were not sex-dependent, although there was a significant difference between men and women for total cholesterol/apoB.NHDLC/apoB offers a simple first-line test for dysbetalipoproteinemia in selecting patients with mixed hyperlipidemia for more complex investigations.},

Increasingly, decision makers, physicians, and other users of diagnostic tests request more than simple measures of a test's analytical or technical performance and diagnostic accuracy; they would also like to see testing lead to health benefits. In this last article of our series, we introduce the notion of clinical utility, which expresses–preferably in a quantitative form–to what extent diagnostic testing improves health outcomes relative to the current best alternative, which could be some other form of testing or no testing at all. In most cases, diagnostic tests improve patient outcomes by providing information that can be used to identify patients who will benefit from helpful downstream management actions, such as effective treatment in individuals with positive test results and no treatment for those with negative results. We describe how comparative randomized clinical trials can be used to estimate clinical utility. We contrast the definition of clinical utility with that of the personal utility of tests and markers. We show how diagnostic accuracy can be linked to clinical utility through an appropriate definition of the target condition in diagnostic-accuracy studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The EuroSCORE associates coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with higher perioperative risk in the first 3 months after a myocardial infarction (MI). The optimal scheduling of CABG surgery after unstable angina (UA) is unknown. We investigated the preoperative predictors of adverse outcomes in patients undergoing CABG with prior MI or UA and investigated the importance of time interval between the cardiac event and CABG. METHODS: The Hospital Episode Statistics database (April 2006-March 2010) was analysed for elective admissions for CABG. Independent preoperative patient factors influencing length of stay, readmission rates, and mortality, were identified by logistic regression and presented as adjusted odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of 10 418 patients with prior MI (mortality 1.8\%) and 5241 patients with prior UA (mortality 2.2\%) were included in the respective cohorts. Multiple risk factors were identified in each population including liver disease and renal failure. The time interval from cardiac event (MI or UA) to elective CABG surgery did not influence perioperative outcomes when analysed as a continuous measure or using the arbitrary 3-month threshold [MI, OR 1.1 (0.78-1.57) and UA, OR 0.65 (0.39-1.09)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis generating data suggest that the increased risk currently allocated in the EuroSCORE for an interval of 3 months between MI and CABG should be critically re-evaluated. Furthermore, prior MI should not be discounted as a risk factor if it is more than 3 months old.},

  abstract = {The use of low-frequency ultrasound has been proposed to enhance the transdermal transport of various drugs, a technique referred to as sonophoresis. The aim of the present study was to determine the safety of low-frequency sonophoresis on human and rat skin by evaluating their structural modifications after ultrasound exposure. Human skin samples and hairless rats were exposed to 20 kHz ultrasound in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Ultrasound was used with average intensities ranging from 0.25 to 7 W/cm(2) in pulsed or continuous mode. Hairless rats were also exposed to a heat source mimicking the temperature versus time profile during sonication. Skin samples were observed under optical and electron microscopy to detect any structural changes. Human skin samples exposed to intensities lower than 2.5 W/cm(2) showed no modification. For hairless rats, slight and transient erythema was observed after 2.5 W/cm(2) exposure, whereas deep lesions (dermal and muscle necrosis) were observed 24 hr later. These lesions were also observed when a plastic film was placed between the coupling medium and the animals' skin during sonication. In contrast, no histologic lesion could be seen when a heat source was applied to animal skin. Low-frequency ultrasound induces delayed and deep lesions in hairless rat skin at 2.5 W/cm(2) which are not only attributable to the increase in temperature at the skin surface during ultrasound exposure. By using the same ultrasound conditions, human skin seems to be less sensitive in vitro.},

In the present study, we assessed the accuracy of the ECQ for diagnosis using DUS. As part of a National Institute of Health Research funded project looking at novel diagnostic methods, 250 patients were studied from 15 general practices across North East England from May 2015 and November 2016. Practices identified those with a PAD diagnosis from their registers as well as age- and sex-matched controls. All the ECQs were recorded by a vascular specialist nurse. Duplex vascular ultrasound scanning was used as a reference standard for the diagnosis of occlusive PAD. The ECQ had a sensitivity of 52.5\% (95\% CI: 42.3\%-62.5\%), specificity of 87.1\% (95\% CI: 80.6\%-92.0\%), positive likelihood ratio of 4.06 (95\% CI: 2.57-6.42), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.55 (95\% CI: 0.44-0.68) compared with reference standard DUS. The ECQ has relatively poor overall diagnostic test accuracy in isolation. It may be helpful in ruling out PAD or as a supplementary test to improve diagnosis of symptomatic disease in General Practice.}

In this paper we focus on cricket and examine what conclusions may be drawn about the ranking of Test batsmen using data on batting scores from the first Test in 1877 onwards. The overlapping nature of playing careers is exploited to form a bridge from past to present so that all players can be compared simultaneously, rather than just relative to their contemporaries. The natural variation in runs scored by a batsman is modelled by an additive log-linear model with year, age and cricket-specific components used to extract the innate ability of an individual cricketer. Incomplete innings are handled via censoring and a zero-inflated component is incorporated into the model to allow for an excess of frailty at the start of an innings. The innings-by-innings variation of runs scored by each batsman leads to uncertainty in their ranking position. A Bayesian approach is used to fit the model and realisations from the posterior distribution are obtained by deploying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Posterior summaries of innate player ability are then used to assess uncertainty in ranking position and this is contrasted with rankings determined via the posterior mean runs scored. Posterior predictive checks show that the model provides a reasonably accurate description of runs scored.},

  abstract = {Diabet. Med. 29, 1553?1555 (2012) Abstract Aims? Current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines state that patients with diabetes should have annual examination of their feet to exclude signs of sensory impairment. The VibraTip is a new disposable device producing a vibratory stimulus, which has been developed in order to screen for peripheral sensory neuropathy in diabetes. This study was designed to evaluate the device by assessing intra-rater reliability and comparing the ability of the VibraTip to detect or exclude peripheral sensory neuropathy with other bedside methods. Methods? One hundred and forty-one patients with diabetes (Type?1 or Type?2) were examined for diabetic peripheral sensory neuropathy using a Neurothesiometer, 10-g monofilament, a 128-Hz tuning fork, a Neurotip? and a VibraTip. The failure to perceive the Neurosthesiometer stimulus at ≥?25?V in either foot was considered the reference method for the presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy. Receiver operating characteristic curves were produced for each device and the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios for the diagnosis of peripheral sensory neuropathy were calculated. Repeat testing with the VibraTip was performed in 18 patients and intra-rater reliability assessed using Cronbach alpha. Results? Analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the 10-g monofilament was significantly better than the 128-Hz tuning fork (P?=?0.0056) and the Neurotip (P?=?0.0022), but was no different from the VibraTip (P?=?0.3214). The alpha coefficient for the VibraTip was calculated to be 0.882, indicating good reliability. Conclusions? The VibraTip is a device comparable with the 10-g monofilament and therefore could be considered a useful tool for screening for peripheral sensory neuropathy in diabetes.},

DESIGN: Long term follow up of a cohort of patients with pituitary adenoma and comparison of tumour occurrence with population incidence rates. SETTING: The Royal Marsden Hospital. SUBJECTS: 334 patients with pituitary adenoma treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy (median dose 45 Gy) and followed up for 3760 person years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Second intracranial tumour and systemic malignancy. RESULTS: Five patients developed a second brain tumour: two had astrocytoma, two meningioma, and one meningeal sarcoma. The cumulative risk of developing a second brain tumour over the first 10 years after treatment was 1.3\% (95\% confidence interval 0.4\% to 3.9\%) and over 20 years 1.9\% (0.7\% to 5.0\%). The relative risk of a second brain tumour compared with the incidence in the normal population was 9.38 (3.05 to 21.89). There was no excess risk of any other type of second primary malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of second intracranial tumour in patients with pituitary adenoma treated with surgery and radiotherapy. Although radiation is likely to be the most important factor contributing to the excess risk, further study is required in a cohort of similar patients not receiving radiation.},

If the variation of the pathway across potential hospitals is large, then it is likely that the evaluation of effectiveness is harder and the route towards large-scale takes adoption longer. Evaluating care pathways can be a time-consuming activity when conducted through clinical audits or interviews with healthcare professionals. We have developed a more rapid methodology which extrapolates the care pathway from local hospital guidelines and assesses their variation. Sepsis kills 46,000 people per year in the UK with societal costs of up to \&pound;10 billion. Therefore, there is a clinical need for an optimized pathway. By applying our method in this field, we were able to assess the variation in current hospital guidelines for sepsis and infer the potential impact this may have on the evidence development on innovations in this applications. We obtained 15 local sepsis guidelines. Two independent reviewers extracted: use of the national early warning score (NEWS), signs and risk factors informing the decision to prescribe antibiotics, and the number of decisional steps up to this point. Considerable variation was observed in all the variables, which is likely to have an impact on future clinical and economic evaluations and adoption of POCT for the identification of patients with sepsis.},

We have analysed a database to compare crude mortality after coronary artery bypass surgery with outcomes that were stratified by risk. Design Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Setting All NHS centres in the geographical north west of England that undertake cardiac surgery in adults. Participants All patients undergoing isolated bypass graft surgery for the first time between April 1999 and March 2002. Main outcome measures Surgeon specific postoperative mortality and predicted mortality by EuroSCORE. Results 8572 patients were operated on by 23 surgeons. Overall mortality was 1.7\%. Observed mortality between surgeons ranged from 0\% to 3.7\%; predicted mortality ranged from 2\% to 3.7\%. Eighty five per cent (7286) of the patients had a EuroSCORE of 5 or less; 49\% of the deaths were in this lower risk group. A large proportion of the variability in predicted mortality between surgeons was due to a small but differing number of high risk patients. Conclusions It is possible to collect risk stratified data on all patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. For most the predicted mortality is low. The small proportion of high risk patients is responsible for most of the differences in predicted mortality between surgeons. Crude comparisons of death rates can be misleading and may encourage surgeons to practise risk averse behaviour. We recommend a comparison of death rates that is stratified by risk and based on low risk cases as the national benchmark for assessing consultant specific performance.},

  abstract = {A model's purpose is to inform medical decisions and health care resource allocation. Modelers employ quantitative methods to structure the clinical, epidemiological, and economic evidence base and gain qualitative insight to assist decision makers in making better decisions. From a policy perspective, the value of a model-based analysis lies not simply in its ability to generate a precise point estimate for a specific outcome but also in the systematic examination and responsible reporting of uncertainty surrounding this outcome and the ultimate decision being addressed. Different concepts relating to uncertainty in decision modeling are explored. Stochastic (first-order) uncertainty is distinguished from both parameter (second-order) uncertainty and from heterogeneity, with structural uncertainty relating to the model itself forming another level of uncertainty to consider. The article argues that the estimation of point estimates and uncertainty in parameters is part of a single process and explores the link between parameter uncertainty through to decision uncertainty and the relationship to value-of-information analysis. The article also makes extensive recommendations around the reporting of uncertainty, both in terms of deterministic sensitivity analysis techniques and probabilistic methods. Expected value of perfect information is argued to be the most appropriate presentational technique, alongside cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, for representing decision uncertainty from probabilistic analysis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To measure the strength of agreement between the concepts and records retrieved from a computerized patient database, in response to physician-derived questions, using a semantic terminological model for clinical findings with those concepts and records excerpted clinically by manual identification. The performance of the semantic terminological model is also compared with the more established retrieval methods of free-text search, ICD-10, and hierarchic retrieval. DESIGN A clinical database (Diabeta) of 106,000 patient problem record entries containing 2,625 unique concepts in an clinical academic department was used to compare semantic, free-text, ICD-10, and hierarchic data retrieval against a gold standard in response to a battery of 47 clinical questions. MEASUREMENTS The performance of concept and record retrieval expressed as mean detection rate, positive predictive value, Yates corrected and Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared values, and Cohen kappa value, with significance estimated using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS The semantic terminological model used to retrieve clinically useful concepts from a patient database performed well and better than other methods, with a mean detection rate of 0.86, a positive predictive value of 0.96, a Yates corrected chi-squared value of 1,537, a Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared value of 19,302, and a Cohen kappa of 0.88. Results for record retrieval were even better, with a mean record detection rate of 0.94, a positive predictive value of 0.99, a Yates corrected chi-squared value of 94, 774, a Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared value of 1,550,356, and a Cohen kappa value of 0.94. The mean detection rate, Yates corrected chi-squared value, and Cohen kappa value for semantic retrieval were significantly better than for the other methods. CONCLUSION The use of a semantic terminological model in this test scenario provides an effective framework for representing clinical finding concepts and their relationships. Although currently incomplete, the model supports improved information retrieval from a patient database in response to clinically relevant questions, when compared with alternative methods of analysis.},

All patients who initiated lumacaftor?ivacaftor from January 1 to December 31, 2016, were eligible. Patients were evaluated for lumacaftor?ivacaftor safety and effectiveness over the first year of treatment following the French CF Learning Society?s recommendations.Measurements and Main Results: Among the 845 patients (292 adolescents and 553 adults) who initiated lumacaftor?ivacaftor, 18.2\% (154 patients) discontinued treatment, often owing to respiratory (48.1\%, 74 patients) or nonrespiratory (27.9\%, 43 patients) adverse events. In multivariable logistic regression, factors associated with increased rates of discontinuation included adult age group, percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) less than 40\%, and numbers of intravenous antibiotic courses during the year before lumacaftor?ivacaftor initiation. Patients with continuous exposure to lumacaftor?ivacaftor showed an absolute increase in ppFEV1 (+3.67\%), an increase in body mass index (+0.73 kg/m2), and a decrease in intravenous antibiotic courses by 35\%. Patients who discontinued treatment had significant decrease in ppFEV1, without improvement in body mass index or decrease in intravenous antibiotic courses.Conclusions: Lumacaftor?ivacaftor was associated with improvement in lung disease and nutritional status in patients who tolerated treatment. Adults who discontinued lumacaftor?ivacaftor, often owing to adverse events, were found at high risk of clinical deterioration.},

  abstract = {© 2017 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor \& Francis Group, LLCObjective: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a novel treatment for severe asthma. Its mode of action and ideal target patient group remain poorly defined, though clinical trials provided some evidence on efficacy and safety. This study presents procedural and short-term safety evidence from routine UK clinical practice. Methods: Patient characteristics and safety outcomes (procedural complications, 30-day readmission and accident and emergency (A\&E) attendance, length of stay) were assessed using two independent data sources, the British Thoracic Society UK Difficult Asthma Registry (DAR) and Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) database. A matched cohort (with records in both) was used to estimate safety outcome event rates and compare them with clinical trials. Results: Between June 2011 and January 2015, 215 procedure records (83 patients; 68 treated in England) were available from DAR and 203 (85 patients) from HES. 152 procedures matched (59 patients; 6 centres), and of these, 11.2\% reported a procedural complication, 11.8\% resulted in emergency respiratory readmission, 0.7\% in respiratory A\&E attendance within 30 days (20.4\% had at least one event) and 46.1\% involved a post-procedure stay. Compared with published clinical trials which found lower hospitalisation rates, BT patients in routine clinical practice were, on average, older, had worse baseline lung function and asthma quality of life. Conclusions: A higher proportion of patients experienced adverse events compared with clinical trials. The greater severity of disease amongst patients treated in clinical practice may explain the observed rate of post-procedural stay and readmission. Study of long-term safety and efficacy requires continuing data collection.},

  abstract = {qRT-PCR (real-time reverse transcription-PCR) has become the benchmark for the detection and quantification of RNA targets and is being utilized increasingly in novel clinical diagnostic assays. Quantitative results obtained by this technology are not only more informative than qualitative data, but simplify assay standardization and quality management. qRT-PCR assays are most established for the detection of viral load and therapy monitoring, and the development of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-associated coronavirus qRT-PCR assays provide a textbook example of the value of this technology for clinical diagnostics. The widespread use of qRT-PCR assays for diagnosis and the detection of disease-specific prognostic markers in leukaemia patients provide further examples of their usefulness. Their value for the detection of disease-associated mRNA expressed by circulating tumour cells in patients with solid malignancies is far less apparent, and the clinical significance of results obtained from such tests remains unclear. This is because of conceptual reservations as well as technical limitations that can interfere with the diagnostic specificity of qRT-PCR assays. Therefore, although it is evident that qRT-PCR assay has become a useful and important technology in the clinical diagnostic laboratory, it must be used appropriately and it is essential to be aware of its limitations if it is to fulfil its potential.},

Tensile strength, collagen deposition (hydroxyproline), reduction in wound size (full-thickness lesion), and mast-cell degranulation were significantly greater in the sonated lesions than in the sham-treated controls (p = 0.01). Sonation enhanced strength by 24\% and collagen deposition by 29\%, when compared with controls. There were no significant differences in the quality of healing as measured by an ordinal scale. The results suggest that within the first week of healing, low-dose ultrasound facilitates wound healing. More research is needed to confirm the most effective dose, frequency, and treatment duration and intervention time for maximum healing.},

The analysis included 11 856 patients.

Surgeons were labelled low-volume (\textbackslash textless or = 6), medium volume (7-20) or high volume (\textbackslash textgreater20). After adjustment for age, sex, principal diagnosis and comorbidity, surgeon volume was much more predictive of short term complications than centre volume. Patients treated by small volume surgeons (respectively medium volume surgeons) had a 43\% higher odds of complications than patients operated by high volume surgeons (respectively 37\%). Despite some limitations, Belgian administrative hospital discharge databases can be used to assess the volume outcome relationship for orthopaedic surgery. The study has emphasized the need to closely monitor individual performance, for hospitals and surgeons. Providers requiring further auditing can be effectively identified with funnel plots used routinely in quality control programs.},

  abstract = {Introduction and objectives: The current definition and classification of acute kidney injury is based on consensus criteria (RIFLE and AKIN systems). Creatinine is the most commonly used of the recommended parameters (creatinine, glomerular filtration rate and diuresis). If the baseline value is not known, it can be calculated based on the simplified MDRD equation, assuming a filtration rate of 75ml/min/1.73m2 for the calculation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic impact of using estimated baseline creatinine compared to the actual value measured in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: Analysis of patients undergoing major cardiac surgery, who were prospectively included in a database. The maximum RIFLE stage reached was calculated for each patient using the measured and estimated baseline creatinine levels. The impact on the diagnosis was analysed using intraclass correlation coefficients, concordance analysis and Bland-Altman plots. Results: The incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury in 2103 cases between 2002 and 2007 was 29.1\%, according to estimated creatinine (14.3\% with the measure). This represents an overestimation of 104\%, with an intraclass correlation of 0.12. By excluding patients with known chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate \textbackslash textless60ml/min/1.73m2), both the overestimation (2.4\%) and the correlation (0.57) improved. Conclusions: The calculation of baseline creatinine using the MDRD equation overestimates the incidence of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery, and is an inadequate method for detection when the baseline value is unknown.}

Design Meta-analysis of 18 randomised controlled trials. Participants 1359 people with essential hypertension allocated to home blood pressure monitoring and 1355 allocated to the “control” group seen in the healthcare system for 2-36 months. Main outcome measures Differences in systolic (13 studies), diastolic (16 studies), or mean (3 studies) blood pressures, and proportion of patients achieving targets (6 studies), between intervention and control groups. Results Systolic blood pressure was lower in people with hypertension who had home blood pressure monitoring than in those who had standard blood pressure monitoring in the healthcare system (standardised mean difference 4.2 (95\% confidence interval 1.5 to 6.9) mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure was lower by 2.4 (1.2 to 3.5) mm Hg, and mean blood pressure was lower by 4.4 (2.0 to 6.8) mm Hg. The relative risk of blood pressure above predetermined targets was lower in people with home blood pressure monitoring (risk ratio 0.90, 0.80 to 1.00). When publication bias was allowed for, the differences were attenuated: 2.2 (−0.9 to 5.3) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and 1.9 (0.6 to 3.2) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions Blood pressure control in people with hypertension (assessed in the clinic) and the proportion achieving targets are increased when home blood pressure monitoring is used rather than standard blood pressure monitoring in the healthcare system. The reasons for this are not clear. The difference in blood pressure control between the two methods is small but likely to contribute to an important reduction in vascular complications in the hypertensive population.},

A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background. The histologic grade of a tumor provides prognostic information in addition to that provided by stage of disease. Poorly differentiated tumors are known to pursue a more aggressive course than their well differentiated counterparts. Methods. The frequency of grading and the relationship of grade to outcome was investigated for 793,649 cases of cancer from 15 anatomic sites as recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Results. For all cancers, the frequency of grading increased from 1973 to 1987 and varied by anatomic site and histologic type. Survival decreased with advancing grade, and within each stage, grading separated cases into at least three distinct prognostic subgroups. For some cancers, regional stage cases assigned Grade 1 or 2 had higher survival rates than did localized stage cases assigned Grade 3 or 4. Therefore, grading allowed the identification of high and low risk subgroups within each stage grouping. Conclusions. The tumor grade was a strong prognostic indicator for cancers of the urinary bladder, endometrium, and prostate?sites most often graded by pathologists. The histologic grade was also an important determinant of outcome for cancers of the brain, soft tissue, and breast; however, only a small percentage of these tumors were graded. The results are important because no common criteria for grading were established among the many contributing pathologists. Therefore, observer variation did not alter the known relationship of histologic grade to outcome. This review demonstrates that the histologic grade is a strong predictor of outcome that refines the prognostic information provided by the stage of disease.},

  abstract = {To detect reasons for the difference in mortality between Scotland and England and Wales a measure of deprivation was studied, comprising overcrowding, unemployment of men, low social class, and not having a car. Data for Scotland for 1980-2 showed this measure to be strongly associated with mortality, with gradients being particularly steep in young adults. Deprivation was much severe in Scotland than in England and Wales. These findings suggest that much excess mortality may be ascribed to more adverse conditions. Standardising the mortality ratios to take account of the relative affluence and deprivation of the two populations led to the differentials observed being radically adjusted, while standardising for social class had little effect. Deprivation measures based on areas overcome many of the limitations associated with social class analysis and also show much greater discrimination between populations. Measures of deprivation apparently provide a powerful basis for explanation of health differences. Such measures should therefore form part of the 1991 census output to facilitate their use on a consistent basis.},

  abstract = {Anaesthetic equipment plays a central role in anaesthetic practice but brings the potential for malfunction or misuse. We aimed to explore the national picture by reviewing patient safety incidents relating to anaesthetic equipment from the National Reporting and Learning System for England and Wales between 2006 and 2008. We searched the database using the system's own classification and by scrutinising the free text of relevant incidents. There were 1029 relevant incidents. Of these, 410 (39.8\%) concerned patient monitoring, most commonly screen failure during anaesthesia, failure of one modality or failure to transfer data automatically from anaesthetic room to operating theatre. Problems relating to ventilators made up 185 (17.9\%) of the reports. Sudden failures during anaesthesia accounted for 142 (13.8\%) of these, with a further 10 cases (0.9\%) where malfunction caused a sustained or increasing positive pressure in the patient's airway. Leaks made up 99 (9.6\%) of incidents and 53 (5.2\%) of incidents arose from the use of infusion pumps. Most (89\%) of the incidents caused no patient harm; only 30 (2.9\%) were judged to have led to moderate or severe harm. Although equipment was often faulty, user error or unfamiliarity also played a part. A large variety of causes led to a relatively small number of clinical scenarios, that anaesthetists should be ready, both individually and organisationally, to manage even when the cause is not apparent. We make recommendations for enhancing patient safety with respect to equipment. You can respond to this article at http://www.anaesthesiacorrespondence.com.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a bronchoscopic procedure in which controlled thermal energy is applied to the airway wall to decrease smooth muscle. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BT versus a sham procedure in subjects with severe asthma who remain symptomatic despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonists. METHODS: A total of 288 adult subjects (Intent-to-Treat [ITT]) randomized to BT or sham control underwent three bronchoscopy procedures. Primary outcome was the difference in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores from baseline to average of 6, 9, and 12 months (integrated AQLQ). Adverse events and health care use were collected to assess safety. Statistical design and analysis of the primary endpoint was Bayesian. Target posterior probability of superiority (PPS) of BT over sham was 95\%, except for the primary endpoint (96.4\%). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The improvement from baseline in the integrated AQLQ score was superior in the BT group compared with sham (BT, 1.35 +/- 1.10; sham, 1.16 +/- 1.23 [PPS, 96.0\% ITT and 97.9\% per protocol]). Seventy-nine percent of BT and 64\% of sham subjects achieved changes in AQLQ of 0.5 or greater (PPS, 99.6\%). Six percent more BT subjects were hospitalized in the treatment period (up to 6 wk after BT). In the posttreatment period (6-52 wk after BT), the BT group experienced fewer severe exacerbations, emergency department (ED) visits, and days missed from work/school compared with the sham group (PPS, 95.5, 99.9, and 99.3\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: BT in subjects with severe asthma improves asthma-specific quality of life with a reduction in severe exacerbations and healthcare use in the posttreatment period.

The versatility and attractiveness of the wavelet approach lie in its decomposition properties, principally its time-scale localization. It is especially relevant to the analysis of non-stationary systems, i.e., systems with short-lived transient components, like those observed in ecological systems. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach for time-series analysis from an ecological perspective. Wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper and illustrated by appropriate synthetic and ecological examples. Wavelet analysis is notably free from the assumption of stationarity that makes most methods unsuitable for many ecological time series. Wavelet analysis also permits analysis of the relationships between two signals, and it is especially appropriate for following gradual change in forcing by exogenous variables.},

The management of patients with raised Lp(a) levels should include: 1) reducing overall atherosclerotic risk; 2) controlling dyslipidemia with a desirable non-HDL-cholesterol level of {$<$}100?mg/dl (2.5?mmol/l) and 3) consideration of lipoprotein apheresis.}

The major challenges relate to its size heterogeneity and related issues including (1) use of appropriate calibrators (2) standardization of calibration protocols (3) traceability and (4) reporting units. In the UK, results from the current EQA schemes for lipoprotein(a) suggest that there is considerable work required to standardize lipoprotein(a) measurement. This is becoming increasingly pertinent with the increasing recognition of lipoprotein(a) as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in international guidelines and the emergence of novel antisense therapies to effectively reduce lipoprotein(a).

They arise from global cooperation coordinated by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation.1 The committee was established in 1992, and in 2000 produced the first guidelines intended for global use.2 The new recommendations for 2005 are described as a “consensus on science,” and they reflect the growing recognition that different countries and regions have varied resources and needs.The consensus statement provides both content and a framework that the main international councils can use and adapt to produce their own broadly similar guidelines with a common core of key recommendations for resuscitation from cardiopulmonary arrest. Both the consensus statement and the European Resuscitation Council guidelines drawn from it can be downloaded from www.erc.edu.3 4 The American Heart Association published the consensus statement and their own guidelines simultaneously.5 6The European guidelines have been adopted by the Resuscitation Council (UK) without modification (www.resus.org.uk).7 The principal changes in the European guidelines since 2000 are both welcome and, on the basis of the available science, broadly as expected. The principal new thrust, supported by much new evidence, is a greater emphasis on the optimal performance of chest compressions.

  abstract = {Hypertension is one of the most prevalent diseases and is often called the \&ldquo;silent killer\&rdquo; because there are usually no early symptoms. Hypertension is also associated with multiple morbidities, including chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Early detection and intervention are therefore important. The current routine method for diagnosing hypertension is done using a sphygmomanometer, which can only provide intermittent blood pressure readings and can be confounded by various factors, such as white coat hypertension, time of day, exercise, or stress. Consequently, there is an increasing need for a non-invasive, cuff-less, and continuous blood pressure monitoring device. Multi-site photoplethysmography (PPG) is a promising new technology that can measure a range of features of the pulse, including the pulse transit time of the arterial pulse wave, which can be used to continuously estimate arterial blood pressure. This is achieved by detecting the pulse wave at one body site location and measuring the time it takes for it to reach a second, distal location. The purpose of this review is to analyze the current research in multi-site PPG for blood pressure assessment and provide recommendations to guide future research. In a systematic search of the literature from January 2010 to January 2019, we found 13 papers that proposed novel methods using various two-channel PPG systems and signal processing techniques to acquire blood pressure using multi-site PPG that offered promising results. However, we also found a general lack of validation in terms of sample size and diversity of populations.},

  abstract = {UK professional bodies have established a number of sectorial working parties to provide guidance on the improvement of radiation safety (RS) culture in the workplace. The medical sector provides unique challenges in this regard, and the remit of the medical group was to review the current state of RS culture and to develop a framework for improvement. The review of current RS culture was based on measurable indicators, including data from regulatory inspections, personal monitoring data and incident data. An online survey to capture the RS-related views and experience of hospital staff at all levels was carried out, and the responses provided a wealth of information on RS awareness and implementation across the country. The framework for improving RS culture includes both top-down initiatives to engage management and regulators, and bottom-up initiatives relating to engagement and training of different staff groups. A Ten-point Assessment on what constitutes a good approach to medical RS culture has been proposed, which provides a tool for management to assess RS culture in the workplace and has potential use in regulatory inspections in the UK.}

  abstract = {Traditional parameters, such as latency and peak velocity, have been used for quantitative analysis of saccade dynamics. However, saccades of equal magnitude which differ substantially in dynamics may still have the same peak velocity. This lack of selectivity might degrade the efficacy of the peak velocity measurement in discriminating patients from normal subjects. In this study, an alternative parameter, the damping ratio of a second-order response, is proposed to concisely and accurately describe saccadic dynamics. A measurement of damping ratio is made by considering the response curve of saccade as the step response of a second-order transfer function. Using the least-mean-square algorithm, the second-order function has been optimized to fit the response of the saccade dynamics with the latency removed. Nineteen normal subjects (ten young and nine older) and 16 patients of Parkinson's disease (eight mildly affected and eight advanced affected) were tested for eye movements in response to pseudorandom saccadic stimuli. While the traditional peak velocity had difficulties in differentiating between the saccadic dynamics of normal and Parkinson subjects, the damping ratio is sensitive enough not only to highlight the difference between a group of patients mildly affected with Parkinson's disease and an age-matched normal group (p\textbackslash textless0.01; abnormal versus normal), but also to distinguish between groups at different ages (p\textbackslash textless0.01; younger versus older). It is proposed that the damping ratio could be a useful parameter in analyzing saccadic dynamics.},

  abstract = {Background Animal studies have shown that peritoneal injury can be minimized by insufflating the abdominal cavity with warm humidified carbon dioxide gas. Methods A single-blind RCT was performed at a tertiary colorectal unit. Inclusion criteria were patient aged 18?years and over undergoing open elective surgery. The intervention group received warmed (37°C), humidified (98 per cent relative humidity) carbon dioxide (WHCO2~group). Multiple markers of peritoneal inflammation and oxidative damage were used to compare groups, including cytokines and chemokines, apoptosis, the 3-chlorotyrosine/native tyrosine ratio, and light microscopy on peritoneal biopsies at the start (T0) and end (Tend) of the operation. Postoperative clinical outcomes were compared between the groups. Results Of 40 patients enrolled, 20 in the WHCO2 group and 19 in the control group were available for analysis. A significant log(Tend/T0) difference between control and WHCO2 groups was documented for interleukin (IL) 2 (5·3 versus 2·8 respectively; P~=~0·028) and IL-4 (3·5 versus 2·0; P~=~0·041), whereas apoptosis assays documented no significant change in caspase activity, and similar apoptosis rates were documented along the peritoneal edge in both groups. The 3-chlorotyrosine/tyrosine ratio had increased at Tend by 1·1-fold in the WHCO2 group and by 3·1-fold in the control group. Under light microscopy, peritoneum was visible in 11 of 19 samples from the control group and in 19 of 20 samples from the WHCO2 group (P~=~0·006). The only difference in clinical outcomes between intervention and control groups was the number of days to passage of flatus (2·5 versus 5·0?days respectively; P~=~0·008). Conclusion The use of warmed, humidified carbon dioxide appears to reduce some markers related to peritoneal oxidative damage during laparotomy. No difference was observed in clinical outcomes, but the study was underpowered for analysis of surgical results. Registration number: NCT02975947 ( www.ClinicalTrials.gov/).},

With ageing, fatigue and fracture of elastin lamellae cause a loss of elasticity defined arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness causes changes of the pulse wave propagation through the arterial tree, which volumetric counterpart can be assessed non-invasively through photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG may be employed in combination with electrocardiography (ECG). It is here reported an implementation of analysis of multisite PPG and single lead ECG relying on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). DCNNs generate peculiar filters allowing for data-driven automated selection of the features of interest. The ability of a DCNN to predict subject's age from PPG (left and right brachial, radial and tibial arteries plus fingers) and ECG (Lead I) in a healthy male population (age range: 20–70 years) was investigated. A performance in age prediction of 7 years of root mean square error was obtained, which was superior to other feature-based procedures. The accuracy in age prediction of the machinery in the healthy population may serve for the generation of age-matched normal ranges for the identification of outliers suggesting cardiovascular diseases manifesting as fastened cardiovascular ageing which is recognized as a risk factor for ischemic diseases.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of ultrasound estimation of fetal weight at term. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study whereby all ultrasonic biometric measurements were done by a single observer. Fifty pregnant women at term had ultrasonic measurement of various fetal biometric parameters performed within a week of delivery. Fetal weight was estimated by the use of four reported methods (Aoki, Campbell, Shepard, and Hadlock formulas). We compared estimated weight with the birth weight after the estimated fetal weight was adjusted by adding 25 g for each day between the ultrasound measurements and delivery. RESULTS: The adjusted estimated fetal weight obtained from all four formulas tended to be lower than measured birth weight. The smallest mean difference was obtained with the Shepard and Aoki formulas (51.4 g and 60.5 g, respectively), whereas the Campbell and Hadlock formulas produced larger mean differences (141.8 g and 190.7 g, respectively). The Aoki formula generated the smallest range between the limits of agreement (-324.2 to 445.2 g) whereas the Campbell formula produced the largest range (-286.5 to 570.1 g). The range between the limits of agreement generated with the Shepard and Hadlock formulas were intermediate between those produced by the Aoki and Campbell formulas. The intraclass correlation coefficients generated with the Aoki and Shepard formulas were identical (0.90). The intraclass correlation coefficients obtained with the Hadlock (0.84) and Campbell formulas (0.85) were lower. CONCLUSION: The validity of ultrasonic estimation of fetal weight at term with all four formulas was high.},

  abstract = {Objective To systematically review methods developed and employed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of medical test when there is a missing or no gold standard.   Study design and settings Articles that proposed or applied any methods to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of medical test(s) in the absence of gold standard were reviewed. The protocol for this review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018089349).   Results Identified methods were classified into four main groups: methods employed when there is a missing gold standard; correction methods (which make adjustment for an imperfect reference standard with known diagnostic accuracy measures); methods employed to evaluate a medical test using multiple imperfect reference standards; and other methods, like agreement studies, and a mixed group of alternative study designs. Fifty-one statistical methods were identified from the review that were developed to evaluate medical test(s) when the true disease status of some participants is unverified with the gold standard. Seven correction methods were identified and four methods were identified to evaluate medical test(s) using multiple imperfect reference standards. Flow-diagrams were developed to guide the selection of appropriate methods.   Conclusion Various methods have been proposed to evaluate medical test(s) in the absence of a gold standard for some or all participants in a diagnostic accuracy study. These methods depend on the availability of the gold standard, its’ application to the participants in the study and the availability of alternative reference standard(s). The clinical application of some of these methods, especially methods developed when there is missing gold standard is however limited. This may be due to the complexity of these methods and/or a disconnection between the fields of expertise of those who develop (e.g. mathematicians) and those who employ the methods (e.g. clinical researchers). This review aims to help close this gap with our classification and guidance tools.},

  abstract = {Continuous recording of arterial blood pressure (ABP) has many applications in cardiovascular physiology, but existing alternatives rely on measurements performed in the fingers or radial artery. Peripheral recordings have significant differences from central ABP regarding the pattern of the waveform and corresponding systolic and diastolic values. To address the need for noninvasive measurements closer to the ascending aorta, a new device was constructed to measure ABP in the superficial temporal artery (STA) using photoplethysmography and the arterial volume clamping technique. The optoelectronic circuitry to generate the photoplethysmogram is contained in a specially designed probe placed over the STA and kept in place with a head frame. The prototype (STAbp) also includes original designs for the pneumatic, electronic, signal processing, control and display sub-systems. A self-calibration feature regularly updates the photoplethysmogram operating point to improve accuracy. The performance of the STAbp was compared against the Finapres in 19 healthy subjects. At rest, the bias (SDd) was -23.1 (15.05), -10.8 (13.83) and -12.4 (12.93) mmHg for systolic, mean and diastolic pressures respectively, without significant differences in drift between the two devices. The 99\% bandwidth (SD) for the spectral distribution of ABP waveforms was 5.3 (1.46) Hz for STAbp and 6.8 (0.73) Hz for the Finapres (p \textbackslash textless 0.01). Handgrip manoeuvre showed a very similar response to the Finapres, including the rapid return to baseline on release. The new STAbp device has considerable potential as a new tool for clinical and research applications where continuous recording of more central ABP is advantageous compared to peripheral alternatives.},

  abstract = {Background:  Muscle flap reconstruction has become a mainstay of therapy following treatment of sternal wound complications; however, success depends on removing wound exudate and infectious material from the wound before reconstruction and closure. Importantly, time to closure is a key factor affecting morbidity/mortality and cost-to-treat for this wound type. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 30 patients who were treated for sternal wound complications between June 2015 and October 2017 was performed. After surgical debridement, group 1 patients (n = 15) received negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d), instilling 1/8-strength Dakin’s solution with a 20-minute dwell time followed by 2 hours of NPWT (-125\,mm Hg); group 2 patients (n = 15) were treated with wet-to-moist dressings soaked in 1/8-strength Dakin’s solution. After muscle flap reconstruction and closure with sutures, group 1 patients received closed incision negative pressure therapy, and group 2 patients received Benzoin and wound closure strips. Data collected included time to closure, therapy duration, number of debridements/dressing changes, drain duration, and complications. Results: There was a significantly shorter time to closure (P {$<$} 0.0001) for group 1 when compared with group 2. In addition, there were fewer therapy days (P = 0.0041), fewer debridements/dressing changes (P = 0.0011), and shorter drain duration (P = 0.0001) for group 1 when compared with group 2. Conclusions: We describe a novel regimen consisting of adjunctive NPWTi-d, along with debridement and systemic antibiotics, followed by closed incision negative pressure therapy after muscle flap reconstruction and closure, to help manage preexisting sternal wounds that had failed to close following a previous cardiac procedure.},

  abstract = {Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition characterized by atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities. While PAD is a major risk factor for lower-extremity amputation, it is also accompanied by a high likelihood for symptomatic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Although much is known regarding PAD in the general population, the assessment and management of PAD in those with diabetes is less clear and poses some special issues. At present, there are no established guidelines regarding the care of patients with both diabetes and PAD.On the 7–8 of May 2003, a Consensus Development Conference was held to review the current knowledge regarding PAD in diabetes. After a series of lectures by experts in the field of endocrinology, cardiology, vascular surgery, orthopedic surgery, podiatry, and nursing, a vascular medicine panel was asked to answer the following questions:1) What is the epidemiology and impact of PAD in people with diabetes?2) Is the biology of PAD different in people with diabetes?3) How is PAD in diabetes best diagnosed and evaluated?4) What are the appropriate treatments for PAD in people with diabetes?PAD is a manifestation of atherosclerosis characterized by atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities and is a marker for atherothrombotic disease in other vascular beds. PAD affects ∼12 million people in the U.S.; it is uncertain how many of those have diabetes. Data from the Framingham Heart Study (1) revealed that 20\% of symptomatic patients with PAD had diabetes, but this probably greatly underestimates the prevalence, given that many more people with PAD are asymptomatic rather than symptomatic. As well, it has been reported that of those with PAD, over one-half are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms, about one-third have claudication, and the remainder have more severe forms of the disease (2).The most common …},

DESIGN--All subjects had measurements of left atrial areas taken in the apical four chamber, parasternal long axis, and parasternal short axis views using both conventional echocardiographic methods and automatic boundary detection on two occasions separated by at least a week. On the second visit measurements were also repeated in healthy volunteers after acute intravenous volume loading with 1 litre of saline over 2-5 minutes. SETTING--A university medical school echocardiographic laboratory. SUBJECTS--12 healthy male volunteers and 8 patients with cardiac disease (5 with congestive heart failure, 1 with mitral stenosis, and 2 with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy, and dilated left atria). RESULTS--There was close correlation between conventionally derived left atrial areas and those obtained by automatic boundary detection, particularly in the apical four chamber view (r = 0.98). Both inter and intra observer variabilities (coefficient of variation) for left atrial areas measured by automatic boundary detection were good (4.7-14.2\% and 8.1-18.6\% respectively). The reproducibility (coefficient of variation) for derived indices of left atrial function, however, was much poorer (10.4-104.8\% and 12.5-88\% respectively). After acute volume loading significant increases in left atrial area were observed at all stages in the cardiac cycle. CONCLUSIONS--These data demonstrate that although the reproducibility of left atrial functional indices is poor, instantaneous left atrial cavity measurements with automatic boundary detection are reproducible. This suggests that automatic boundary detection may assist in serial non-invasive measurement of left atrial size to assess disease states and treatments.},

  abstract = {Initially, a set of guidelines for the use of ultrasound contrast agents was published in 2004 dealing only with liver applications. A second edition of the guidelines in 2008 reflected changes in the available contrast agents and updated the guidelines for the liver, as well as implementing some non-liver applications. Time has moved on, and the need for international guidelines on the use of CEUS in the liver has become apparent. The present document describes the third iteration of recommendations for the hepatic use of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using contrast specific imaging techniques. This joint WFUMB-EFSUMB initiative has implicated experts from major leading ultrasound societies worldwide. These liver CEUS guidelines are simultaneously published in the official journals of both organizing federations (i.e., Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology for WFUMB and Ultraschall in der Medizin/European Journal of Ultrasound for EFSUMB). These guidelines and recommendations provide general advice on the use of all currently clinically available ultrasound contrast agents (UCA). They are intended to create standard protocols for the use and administration of UCA in liver applications on an international basis and improve the management of patients worldwide.},

  abstract = {Summary Regulatory and reimbursement authorities face uncertain choices when considering the adoption of health-care technologies. In this Viewpoint, we present an analytic framework that separates the issue of whether a technology should be adopted on the basis of existing evidence from whether more research should be demanded to support future decisions. We show the application of this framework to the assessment of heath-care technologies using a published analysis of a new drug treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The results of the analysis show that the amount and type of evidence required to support the adoption of a health technology will differ substantially between technologies with different characteristics. Additionally, the analysis can be used to aid the efficient design of research. We discuss the implications of adoption of this new framework for regulatory and reimbursement decisions.},

  abstract = {Recently the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) updated its methods guidance for technology assessment. One aspect of the new guidance is to require the use of probabilistic sensitivity analysis with all cost-effectiveness models submitted to the Institute. The purpose of this paper is to place the NICE guidance on dealing with uncertainty into a broader context of the requirements for decision making; to explain the general approach that was taken in its development; and to address each of the issues which have been raised in the debate about the role of probabilistic sensitivity analysis in general. The most appropriate starting point for developing guidance is to establish what is required for decision making. On the basis of these requirements, the methods and framework of analysis which can best meet these needs can then be identified. It will be argued that the guidance on dealing with uncertainty and, in particular, the requirement for probabilistic sensitivity analysis, is justified by the requirements of the type of decisions that NICE is asked to make. Given this foundation, the main issues and criticisms raised during and after the consultation process are reviewed. Finally, some of the methodological challenges posed by the need fully to characterise decision uncertainty and to inform the research agenda will be identified and discussed.},

  abstract = {The policy debate about price, value, and innovation in pharmaceuticals is at a critical stage for the NHS. Claxton and colleagues describe the key principles of value based pricing and consider some of the concerns about such a schemeThe NHS spends about £11bn (€15bn, \$22bn) annually on pharmaceuticals, of which £8bn is on branded drugs, representing about 13\% and 10\% respectively of available resources.1 As growth in NHS funding is expected to slow, access to innovative technologies will depend on savings found elsewhere. The UK Department of Health uses the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme to control expenditure on branded drugs. This 50 year old scheme is intended to control the profits companies can earn through periodic and general price cuts. A report by the Office of Fair Trading recommended reform, basing a drug’s price on its health benefits.1 2 The government has confirmed its intention to renegotiate the existing scheme,3 and a recent House of Commons Health Committee report has also welcomed reform.4 5 The policy debate about price, value, and innovation is at a critical stage for the NHS.Establishing the value of a drug requires an assessment of whether the additional health expected to be gained from its use exceeds the health forgone as other NHS treatments are displaced by its additional cost—a comparison of the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER, the ratio of the additional health gained to the additional costs) with a threshold for cost effectiveness (see box 1). The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) uses a threshold of £20\,000 to £30\,000 per QALY, representing an estimate of the health forgone based on the estimated productivity of other NHS activities.6 This range maybe too high.7 8 Critically, this key determinant of value ought to be removed …},

  abstract = {Summary Between October 1997 and June 2001, 140 English hospitals participating in the surveillance of surgical site infection (SSI) with the Nosocomial Infection National Surveillance Service (NINSS) reported 2832 SSIs following 67\hphantom{,}410 surgical procedures in nine defined categories of surgery. Limb amputation had the highest incidence of SSI with 14.3 SSIs per 100 operations. For all categories of surgery, except knee prosthesis (P=0.128), there was a linear increase in the incidence of SSI when the American National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance risk index increased. Superficial incisional SSI was more common than deep incisional and organ/space SSI, and accounted for more than half of all SSIs for all categories of surgery. The postoperative length of stay (LOS) was longer for patients with SSI, and when adjusted for other factors influencing LOS, the extra LOS due to SSI ranged from 3.3 days for abdominal hysterectomy to 21.0 days for limb amputation, and was at least nine days for the other categories. The additional cost attributable to SSI ranged from £959 for abdominal hysterectomy to £6103 for limb amputation. Deep incisional and organ/space SSI combined incurred a greater extra LOS and cost than superficial incisional SSI for all categories of surgery, except limb amputation. The crude mortality rate was higher for patients with SSI for all categories of surgery but, after controlling for confounding, only patients with SSI following hip prosthesis had a mortality rate that was significantly higher than those without SSI [odds ratio (OR)=1.8, P=0.002]. However, the adjusted mortality rate for patients with deep incisional and organ/space SSI compared with those without SSI was significantly higher for vascular surgery (OR=6.8, P{$<$}0.001), hip prosthesis (OR=2.5, P=0.005) and large bowel surgery (OR=1.8, P=0.04). This study shows that the adverse impact of SSI differs greatly for different categories of surgery, and highlights the importance of measuring the impact for defined categories rather than for all SSIs and all surgical procedures.},

  abstract = {A new medical device has been designed for inducing hypothermia in kidneys, via laparoscopic deployment, without leaving residual fluid in the abdomen. It was tested in laboratory and animal trials to ascertain its suitability for achieving a target renal temperature of 15°C for tissue preservation within a 30-min period. A simple theoretical model was developed to calculate cooling rates under ideal circumstances. In the laboratory, a potato was used as the model for the kidney and an average minimum temperature of 15.8°C was reached in 30~min. The theoretical model calculated this as 9.9°C. In the animal trials, an average minimum temperature of 11.4°C was reached in 30~min, compared to the calculated temperature of 9.8°C from the theoretical model. In conclusion, the new device can cool as affectively as other techniques trialled, with the added advantage that it does not release cold fluid or ice into the abdomen.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a real-time electronic alert system or "AKI sniffer," which is based on the RIFLE classification criteria (Risk, Injury and Failure), would have an impact on therapeutic interventions and acute kidney injury progression. DESIGN: Prospective intervention study. SETTING: Surgical and medical intensive care unit in a tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 951 patients having in total 1,079 admission episodes were admitted during the study period (prealert control group: 227, alert group: 616, and postalert control group: 236). INTERVENTIONS: Three study phases were compared: A 1.5-month prealert control phase in which physicians were blinded for the acute kidney injury sniffer and a 3-month intervention phase with real-time alerting of worsening RIFLE class through the Digital Enhanced Cordless Technology telephone system followed by a second 1.5-month postalert control phase. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 2593 acute kidney injury alerts were recorded with a balanced distribution over all study phases. Most acute kidney injury alerts were RIFLE class risk (59.8\%) followed by RIFLE class injury (34.1\%) and failure (6.1\%). A higher percentage of patients in the alert group received therapeutic intervention within 60 mins after the acute kidney injury alert (28.7\% in alert group vs. 7.9\% and 10.4\% in the pre- and postalert control groups, respectively, p μ .001). In the alert group, more patients received fluid therapy (23.0\% vs. 4.9\% and 9.2\%, p μ .01), diuretics (4.2\% vs. 2.6\% and 0.8\%, p μ .001), or vasopressors (3.9\% vs. 1.1\% and 0.8\%, p μ .001). Furthermore, these patients had a shorter time to intervention (p μ .001). A higher proportion of patients in the alert group showed return to a baseline kidney function within 8 hrs after an acute kidney injury alert "from normal to risk" compared with patients in the control group (p = .048). CONCLUSIONS: The real-time alerting of every worsening RIFLE class by the acute kidney injury sniffer increased the number and timeliness of early therapeutic interventions. The borderline significant improvement of short-term renal outcome in the RIFLE class risk patients needs to be confirmed in a large multicenter trial.},

  abstract = {Accurate coding is essential for local and national data reporting and for contracting. It is also integral to clinical governance. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of coding in Morriston Hospital plastic surgery theatres and coding office, to reaudit and address poor practice. A third coding system, a computerised logbook developed by the senior author, was not analysed in this study. Fifty operations coded using OPCS-4 were compared with a gold standard for overall accuracy, primary and procedural codes. Results were discussed with all relevant staff and reaudit took place 3 months later. The data were analysed using the paired Student's t -test for intergroup comparisons and the unpaired test for intragroup assessment. At initial audit, the coding office was significantly better than theatre staff in overall accuracy (78\% vs 43\% respectively P\textbackslash textless 0.01) and in procedural codes (98\% vs 42\%, P\textbackslash textless 0.01) but there was no difference in primary codes (62\% vs 74\%). At reaudit the only significant improvement was in overall accuracy of coding office records, although the clinical coders were now significantly better at recording primary codes than theatre staff (76\% vs 56\%, P\textbackslash textless 0.05). The conclusions were that the quality of coding in theatre was poor and should stop. Clinical coders performed better but 1/3-1/4 of essential codes were inaccurate. This may have been due to limited understanding of terminology and techniques, difficulty reading operation notes and complexity of OPCS-4. Recommendations included closer cooperation between surgeons and coders to support and improve clinical coding performance.},

  abstract = {Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) continues to grow in global prevalence and consumes an increasing amount of resources in the United States health care system. Overall rates of intervention for PAD have been rising steadily in recent years. Changing demographics, evolution of technologies, and an expanding database of outcomes studies are primary forces influencing clinical decision making in PAD. The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a {$>$}50\% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2~years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.},

  abstract = {Aim To determine radiology departmental compliance with current UK guidance on contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) and to provide data on the incidence of clinically significant post-contrast AKI (PC-AKI) in computed tomography (CT) practice. Materials and methods A questionnaire was sent to all UK acute National Health Service (NHS) providers (NHS boards in Scotland, local health boards in Wales, NHS trusts in England and health and social care trusts in Northern Ireland) to assess compliance of provider protocols with current UK guidelines for the prevention, recognition, and management of CI-AKI. Audit data were collected for 40 consecutive fit outpatients and 40 consecutive acutely unwell patients/inpatients from hospitals within each participating provider to assess clinical compliance. Results Eighty-nine of 172 (52\%) health service providers responded, and data on 7,159 contrast-enhanced CT examinations were provided. Compliance with guidelines was poor with wide variation in clinical practice. The observed incidence of clinically significant (requiring treatment or resulting in death) PC-AKI was zero in 3,590 outpatients, although two patients developed AKI due to other causes (sepsis and progressive malignancy). Fourteen out of 3,569 (0.4\%) patients in the inpatient group developed clinically significant PC-AKI, and a further 17 patients were identified who met the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition of AKI (Electronic Supplementary Material Appendix S1), but did not require active treatment, giving an overall incidence of AKI of 0.9\%. In patients at high risk due to impaired renal function prior to the scan, there was no difference in the median serum creatinine (SCr) before and after contrast medium administration in either group. Conclusion Health service provider protocols and clinical practice demonstrate poor compliance with current UK guidance on CI-AKI. A very low incidence of PC- AKI was demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Background:  Acute renal failure (ARF) in trauma patients is associated with high mortality rates. There is currently no consensus definition for renal failure, however, the American College of Surgeons’ Committee on Trauma (ACSCOT) defines ARF as a serum creatinine ≥3.5, blood urea nitrogen {$>$} 100, or renal replacement therapy. We hypothesize that by using the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) staging system we would identify smaller changes in renal function that may impact outcome, and may serve as a marker for mortality and other organ dysfunction. Methods: We retrospectively identified all trauma patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for {$>$}48 hours during a 3-year period ending December 2007. Hourly urine output, serum creatinine, demographic data, trauma scores, admission vital signs, ICU and hospital length of stay, need for renal replacement therapy, organ failure, and death were collected and were stratified according to AKIN and ACSCOT renal dysfunction criteria. Trauma patients admitted to the SICU who did not develop renal dysfunction were used as controls. Results: A total of 571 patients were studied. Of those, only 17 patients (3.0\%) were classified as having ARF by the ACSCOT criteria, whereas 170 (29.8\%) had kidney injury using the AKIN criteria (146, stage 1; 15, stage 2; 9, stage 3). Compared with patients admitted to the ICU for ≥48 hours with normal renal function, patients meeting AKIN criteria had longer hospital and ICU length of stay (p {$<$} 0.001). Patients meeting AKIN criteria also had an increased incidence of multiple organ failure and death (p {$<$} 0.03). Conclusions: Stratification using the AKIN criteria for acute kidney injury identifies an increased number of patients with renal dysfunction compared with the current ACSCOT criteria. Importantly, these patients have an increased risk of multiple organ failure and death. Inclusion into the AKIN criteria may be a marker for later morbidity and mortality.},

Intravenous loop diuretics reduce the signs and symptoms of congestion. Loop diuretics, however, may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality because of deleterious effects on neurohormonal activation, electrolyte balance, and cardiac and renal function. Ultrafiltration, an alternative method of sodium and water removal, safely improves hemodynamics in heart failure patients. Recent findings The Ultrafiltration versus Intravenous Diuretics for Patients Hospitalized for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure trial has recently shown that among 200 volume overloaded heart failure patients randomized to ultrafiltration or intravenous diuretics, 48 h weight (P = 0.001) and net fluid loss (P = 0.001) were greater in the ultrafiltration group. Dyspnea scores were similar. At 90 days, the ultrafiltration group had fewer heart failure rehospitalizations/patient (P = 0.022) and patients presenting for unscheduled visits (21 vs. 44\%; P = 0.009). No serum creatinine differences occurred between the groups. Summary In decompensated heart failure, ultrafiltration safely produces greater weight and fluid loss than intravenous diuretics, reduces rehospitalization rates for heart failure and is an effective alternative therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy of the Newcastle infant dialysis and ultrafiltration system (Nidus) with peritoneal dialysis (PD) and conventional haemodialysis (HD) in infants weighing \textbackslash textless8 kg. METHODS: We compared the urea, creatinine and phosphate clearances, the ultrafiltration precision, and the safety of the Nidus machine with PD in 7 piglets weighing 1-8 kg, in a planned randomised cross-over trial in babies, and in babies for whom no other therapy existed, some of whom later graduated to conventional HD. RESULTS: Two babies entered the randomised trial; 1 recovered rapidly on PD, the other remained on the Nidus as PD failed. Additionally, 9 babies were treated on the Nidus on humanitarian grounds: 3 because of failed PD, and 3 with permanent kidney failure later converted to conventional HD. We haemodialysed 10 babies weighing between 1.8 and 5.9 kg for 2,475 h during 354 Nidus sessions without any clinically important incidents, and without detectable haemolysis. Single-lumen vascular access was used with no blood priming of circuits. The urea, creatinine and phosphate clearances using the Nidus were around 1.5 to 2.0 ml/min in piglets and babies, and were consistently higher than PD clearances, which ranged from about 0.2 to 0.8 ml/min (p ≤ 0.0002 for each chemical). Ultrafiltration was achieved to microlitre precision by the Nidus, but varied widely with PD. Fluid removal using conventional HD was imprecise and resulted in some hypovolaemic episodes requiring correction. CONCLUSION: The Nidus can provide HD in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and outpatient intermittent HD without blood priming for babies weighing \textbackslash textless8 kg, It generates higher dialysis clearances than PD, and delivers more precise ultrafiltration control than either PD or conventional HD.},

  abstract = {Whereas the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals is an established practice within international health technology assessment (HTA) and is often produced with the support of comprehensive methodological guidance, the equivalent procedure for medical devices is less developed. Medical devices, including diagnostic products, are a rapidly growing market in healthcare, with over 10,000 medical technology patent applications filed in Europe in 2012-nearly double the number filed for pharmaceuticals. This increase in the market place, in combination with the limited, or constricting, budgets that healthcare decision makers face, has led to a greater level of examination with respect to the economic evaluation of medical devices. However, methodological questions that arise due to the unique characteristics of medical devices have yet to be addressed fully. This review of journal publications and HTA guidance identified these characteristics and the challenges they may subsequently pose from an economic evaluation perspective. These unique features of devices can be grouped into four categories: (1) data quality issues; (2) learning curve; (3) measuring long-term outcomes from diagnostic devices; and (4) wider impact from organisational change. We review the current evaluation toolbox available to researchers and explore potential future approaches to improve the economic evaluation of medical devices.},

The fractal dimensions of images from haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of 359 colorectal polyps (214 tubulovillous adenomas, 41 ?pure? tubular adenomas, 29 ?pure? villous adenomas, 68 metaplastic polyps, and 7 inflammatory polyps) were measured using a box-counting method implemented on a microcomputer-based image analysis system. Results were assessed using polychotomous logistic regression, confusion matrices, and kappa statistics. All examined polyps were shown to have a fractal structure in the range of scales examined. The fractal dimension was significantly different between different diagnostic categories (P{$<$}0·0001) and was a useful discriminant between these categories (kappa statistic 0·60 for the confusion matrix with size as the other variable). The fractal dimension did not shown any significant correlation with the grade of epithelial dysplasia (P{$>$}0·05). This study shows that colorectal polyps have a fractal structure over a defined range of magnification and Euclidean morphometric measurements will be invalid outside precisely defined conditions of resolution and magnification. The fractal dimension is a better way of quantitating the polyp shape and is a useful morphometric discriminant between diagnostic categories.},

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was the first, and still the most widely used, test. However, several days can elapse between requesting a test and getting and acting on a result, leaving a window in which infection may spread. A further problem is that people may transmit infection before recognising symptoms1—a key driver of spread. In addition, some people who remain asymptomatic have a similar viral load to those who develop symptoms and may also contribute to spread, although the extent of this is unclear.123 Given the importance of presymptomatic or paucisymptomatic transmission,1 measures that shorten the time between testing and results are essential for minimising onward transmission. It is difficult to achieve this with large scale PCR testing.Rapid antigen lateral flow tests offer an alternative. They provide a rapid result but are less able to detect infections.4 Governments are purchasing them in large quantities, with some seeing a single test as a way to free an individual from quarantine obligations, a view not supported by the World Health Organization.4 However, repeated lateral flow testing may have value in combination with other measures. In Liverpool, UK, for example, authorities are examining test-to-protect, test-to-release (from quarantine), and test-to-enable (safer return to restricted activities) regimens, alongside outbreak response and public open access to lateral flow testing.5 Such real world evaluations are needed to understand how these models work in different populations and settings, how they influence behaviour, and the contribution of lateral flow tests to overall strategies, where they have …}

The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group has proposed the RIFLE (Risk–Injury–Failure–Loss–ESRD) classification to standardize the approach to AKI. This study was performed to estimate the AKI incidence in ICU patients in northeastern Italy and describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with AKI on the basis of their RIFLE class. A prospective multicenter observational study was performed of patients who fulfilled AKI criteria in 19 ICU in northeastern Italy. Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression and survival curve analysis. Of 2164 ICU patients who were admitted during the study period, 234 (10.8\%; 95\% confidence interval 9.5 to 12.1\%) developed AKI; 19\% were classified as risk (R), 35\% as injury (I), and 46\% as failure (F). Preexisting kidney disease was present in 36.8\%. The most common causes of AKI were prerenal causes (38.9\%) and sepsis (25.6\%). At diagnosis of AKI, median serum creatinine and urine output were 2.0 mg/dl and 1100 ml/d, respectively. ICU mortality was 49.5\% in class F, 29.3\% in I, and 20\% in R. Independent risk factors for mortality included RIFLE class, sepsis, and need for renal replacement therapy, whereas a postsurgical cause of AKI, exposure to nephrotoxins, higher serum creatinine, and urine output were associated with lower mortality risk. In this study, AKI incidence in the ICU was between 9 and 12\%, with 3.3\% of ICU patients requiring renal replacement therapy. Sepsis was a significant contributing factor. Overall mortality was between 30 and 42\%, and was highest among those in RIFLE class F.},

This indicates a highly encouraging acceptance by the medical community of a unifying definition for acute kidney injury. This is a very important and positive step in the right direction. There remains some variation in how the criteria are interpreted and used in the literature, including use/nonuse of urine output criteria, use of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate rather than change in creatinine, and choice of baseline creatinine. The present review is intended to aid the reader in critically appraising studies using these consensus definitions. Since no single definition will be perfect, a logical next step would be to reconcile existing definitions, moving the medical community towards using a single consensus definition as has been done with sepsis and acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. As new data emerge, integration of novel biomarkers into the consensus definition will be a welcome refinement.},

  abstract = {This software article describes the GATE family of open source text analysis tools and processes. GATE is one of the most widely used systems of its type with yearly download rates of tens of thousands and many active users in both academic and industrial contexts. In this paper we report three examples of GATE-based systems operating in the life sciences and in medicine. First, in genome-wide association studies which have contributed to discovery of a head and neck cancer mutation association. Second, medical records analysis which has significantly increased the statistical power of treatment/outcome models in the UK's largest psychiatric patient cohort. Third, richer constructs in drug-related searching. We also explore the ways in which the GATE family supports the various stages of the lifecycle present in our examples. We conclude that the deployment of text mining for document abstraction or rich search and navigation is best thought of as a process, and that with the right computational tools and data collection strategies this process can be made defined and repeatable. The GATE research programme is now 20 years old and has grown from its roots as a specialist development tool for text processing to become a rather comprehensive ecosystem, bringing together software developers, language engineers and research staff from diverse fields. GATE now has a strong claim to cover a uniquely wide range of the lifecycle of text analysis systems. It forms a focal point for the integration and reuse of advances that have been made by many people (the majority outside of the authors' own group) who work in text processing for biomedicine and other areas. GATE is available online \textbackslash textless1\textbackslash textgreater under GNU open source licences and runs on all major operating systems.

  abstract = {The effect of xylometazoline, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, on ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was tested on samples of human nasal epithelium in vitro. Ciliated tissue was obtained from the inferior nasal turbinates of five normal individuals. CBF was measured from video recordings of ciliary activity using a computer-assisted photometric technique. The mean CBF of cells from the five subjects, followed for 40 min without xylometazoline, was 12.0 ± 1.1 Hz. All concentrations of xylometazoline significantly decreased ciliary beat frequency. After a 10-min exposure, the mean CBF dropped to 3.8 ± 0.4 with 0.1\% xylometazoline, 4.9 ± 1.0 with 0.05\%, and 8.1 ± 0.9 with 0.025\%. Washing with control culture medium at least partially reversed the inhibition within 10 min. Phentolamine (10−3 M), an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, did not alter CBF significantly when used alone, but partially blocked the strong cilioinhibitory effect of xylometazoline. This action of xylometazoline is similar to that of several commercially prepared decongestants that contain potentially ciliotoxic preservatives in addition to alpha-adrenergic agonists and supports the view that alpha-adrenergic agonists act directly on ciliated cells to inhibit ciliary activity.},

  abstract = {Acute decompensated heart failure is the most common reason for inpatient hospital admission. Most patients admitted for decompensated heart failure are by definition diuretic-resistant. The therapeutic objective for these patients is volume and sodium removal and restoration of diuretic sensitivity. In a significant proportion of patients, this objective is not met, subjecting patients to readmission for recurrent heart failure decompensation. Ultrafiltration therapy offers the potential of greater volume and sodium removal as compared with conventional therapies in a more expeditious manner. Ultrafiltration can be safely and effectively accomplished in a non-intensive care setting but relies on earlier discharge with reduced readmission rates to be economically feasible. This paper reviews the current data regarding ultrafiltration therapy and provides a practical guide to patient selection, implementation and management of this therapy.},

  abstract = {The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issues mandatory guidance on health technologies to the UK NHS, based on clinical evidence, cost-effectiveness and other considerations. However, the exact factors considered, their relative importance and tradeoffs between them are not made explicit. Previous research modelled NICE decisions as a binary choice (accept/reject) dependent on cost-effectiveness, amongst other variables. This paper proposes and tests an alternative model of decision-making that may better represent the "yes, but..." nature of many NICE decisions. Decisions were categorised as "recommended for routine use", "recommended for restricted use" or "not recommended". The NICE appraisal process was modelled as a single decision between the three categories. Multinomial logistic regression techniques were used to evaluate the impact of: quantity/quality of clinical evidence; cost-effectiveness; decision date; existence of alternative treatments; budget impact; technology type. Results suggest that interventions supported by more randomised trials are more likely to be recommended and endorsed for routine use. Higher cost-effectiveness ratios increased the likelihood of interventions being rejected rather than recommended for restricted use but did not significantly affect the decision between routine and restricted use. Pharmaceuticals, interventions appraised early in the NICE programme and those with more systematic reviews were also less likely to be rejected, while patient group submissions made a recommendation for routine rather than restricted use more likely. The presence of factors affecting the decision between routine and restricted use but not that between routine use and rejection suggests that modelling these three outcomes reflects NICE decision-making more closely than binary-choice analyses.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT We aim to establish whether it is ever appropriate to conduct cost-minimisation analysis (CMA) rather than cost-effectiveness analysis.We perform a literature review to examine how the use of CMA has changed since Briggs \& O'Brien announced its death in 2001. Examples of simulated and trial data are presented: firstly to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of CMA in the context of non-inferiority trials and those finding no significant difference in efficacy and secondly to assess whether CMA gives biased results.We show that CMA is still used and will bias measures of uncertainty, causing overestimation or underestimation of the value of information and the probability that treatment is cost-effective. Although bias will be negligible for non-inferiority studies comparing treatments that differ enormously in cost, it is generally necessary to collect and analyse data on costs and efficacy (including utilities) to assess this bias. Cost-effectiveness analysis (including evaluation of the joint distribution of costs and benefits) is almost always required to avoid biased estimation of uncertainty. The remit of CMA in trial-based economic evaluation is therefore even narrower than previously thought, suggesting that CMA is not only dead but should also be buried.

The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) developing in patients with reduced kidney function following exposure to intravenous iodinated contrast media has been overstated. This is due primarily to historic lack of control groups sufficient to separate contrast-induced AKI (CI-AKI; ie, AKI caused by contrast media administration) from contrast-associated AKI (CA-AKI; ie, AKI coincident to contrast media administration). Although the true risk of CI-AKI remains uncertain for patients with severe kidney disease, prophylaxis with intravenous normal saline is indicated for patients who have AKI or an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 who are not undergoing maintenance dialysis. In individual high-risk circumstances, prophylaxis may be considered in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30?44 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the discretion of the ordering clinician.

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction The authors provide an updated, systematic and comprehensive summary of the literature concerning management of the N0 neck in patients for whom primary irradiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx has been unsuccessful and salvage surgery in the form of total laryngectomy (TL) advocated. Methods Bibliographic databases MEDLINE, Cochrane, PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to April 2019, with no language restrictions. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Risk of bias was defined using the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. Outcome measures were defined as the impact of END on locoregional control, complication rate, disease-specific and overall survival (DSS and OS). Results The primary search identified 19 eligible articles, comprising 1353 patients, (1552 ENDs). The overall risk of occult metastases was 14\% (9\% of ENDs). The relative risk (RR) of developing complications was 1.29 when END was performed, compared to observation of the neck (CI 0.86-1.92). Contrariwise, patients in whom the neck was managed with neck dissection had a decreased risk of developing regional recurrence (RR 0.62, CI 0.35-1.08). There was no statistically significant variation between DSS and OS between END and neck observation groups, respectively. Summary END during salvage TL may reduce the rate of regional recurrence, but not at the expense of improving DSS or OS. Rates of occult metastases, regional recurrence and ?cure? through salvage neck dissection are not equivalent. Significant bias in all collated manuscripts should encourage the reader to interpret conclusions with caution. Patients should be fully involved in the decision-making process and their performance status and co-morbidities taken carefully into account when deciding to increase the extent of surgery, which we believe should remain limited to TL in the majority of cases.},

  abstract = {Objective: To implement a government-led project—the ‘Defibrillators in Public Places’ Initiative—to deploy Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) in public places. Background: A Defibrillator Advisory Committee (DAC) was formed to assist the government with the implementation of the project. Its particular tasks were to: recommend criteria for the selection, training and assessment of those individuals likely to use the devices; procure the equipment necessary for the implementation of the project; procure the training services required for the implementation of the project; ensure the AEDs are sited where they are most likely to be of benefit; establish a mechanism to audit the use of this equipment and the outcome of this initiative. To co-ordinate this project a National Project Manager was appointed. Consultation with Ambulance Services NHS Trusts established the places where cardiac arrest occurred under circumstance where the availability of a defibrillator might be most likely to be effective. Defibrillators were procured under the direction of the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency in conjunction with medical advisors. Devices that were reliable, safe, simple in operation and with good data retrieval systemes were selected. Training contracts were awarded under the direction of the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency in conjunction with medical and educational advisors. Organisations with accredited training experience and possessing the appropriate administrative and data handling abilities were selected. The ability to undertake training in an area concordant with current NHS regions was an essential requirement. In the first stage of implementation, pilot trials were successfully established at sites where persons were willing to be trained in the use of automated defibrillators. Arrangements for national progress of the project were made on the basis of the experience gained at pilot sites. A robust system for monitoring the outcome of the project has been established in partnership with the Resuscitation Council UK. The long-term success of this innovative project requires: Continuing central administrative support in the short to medium term. Central audit and data collection. The results of this project should contribute to national databases being established by the Resuscitation Council UK. Continuing adequate funding. The recognition that the provision of defibrillation to the victims of cardiac arrest is a key feature of the NHS.},

However, the feasibility and value of primary care PAD screening is uncertain.Aim This study (the PIPETTE study — Peripheral arterial disease In Primary carE: Targeted screening and subsequenT managEment) aimed to determine the value of a proposed primary care PAD screening strategy. Outcomes assessed were: prevalence of PAD and agreement of ankle– brachial index (ABI)-defined PAD (ABI ≤0.9) with QRISK®2-defined high CV risk (≥20).Design and setting A cross-sectional observational study was undertaken in a large general practice in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales.Method In total, 1101 individuals with ≥2 pre-identified CV risk factors but no known CV disease or diabetes were invited to participate. Participants underwent ABI measurement and QRISK2 assessment, and completed Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaires.Results A total of 368 people participated in the study (participation rate: 33\%). Prevalence of PAD was 3\% (n = 12). The number needed to screen (NNS) to detect one new case of PAD was 31. Refining the study population to those aged ≥50 years with a smoking history reduced the NNS to 14, while still identifying 100\% of PAD cases. Of participants with PAD, 33\% reported severe lifestyle-limiting symptoms of intermittent claudication that warranted subsequent endovascular intervention, yet had not previously presented to their GP. The QRISK2 score predicted high CV risk in 92\% of participants with PAD.Conclusion The low PAD yield and the fact that QRISK2 was largely comparable to the ABI in predicting high CV risk suggests that routine PAD screening may be unwarranted. Instead, strategies to improve public awareness of PAD are needed.},

Patients were also assessed clinically and with echocardiography. Mortality was tracked for 8 years. Atrial fibrillation was found in 78 of the random population sample (2.0\%). Prevalence was 1.6\% in women and 2.4\% in men, rising with age from 0.2\% in those aged 45–54 to 8.0\% in those aged 75 and older. Half of all cases were in patients aged 75 and older. Only 23 of the 78 (29.5\%) of those in AF took warfarin. Of the 782 patients, 175 (22.4\%) with a diagnosis of heart failure were in AF, with normal left ventricular function in 95 (54.3\%) of these.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is sensitive but the inherent delays in result availability potentially prolong time to isolation and treatment.

Aim To evaluate diagnostic accuracy, time to result availability, clinical impact, and cost consequences of Alere™ i Influenza A\&B NPT (Alere Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) using off-label throat swabs. Methods Prospective, multi-centre [four UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals], diagnostic accuracy cohort study with cost modelling. Throat swab samples from suspected influenza patients were tested for influenza using the reference standard of PCR; a second throat swab was tested using NPT. Findings A total of 827 participants were recruited; 589 were suitable for analysis: sensitivity was 75.8\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 67.0–84.6]; specificity was 96.8\% (95\% CI: 95.2–98.3). Sensitivity varied between Sheffield (Northern General Hospital: 82.1\%; Royal Hallamshire Hospital: 83.3\%) and other sites (Doncaster Royal Infirmary: 71.4\%; Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary: 50.0\%) whereas specificity was high (92–100\%). Positive predictive value (PPV) was 81.2\% (95\% CI: 72.9–89.5) with negative predictive value 95.6\% (95\% CI: 93.9–97.4) with observed prevalence of 15.4\%. Median time to result for PCR was 1.1 days (on-site laboratories) and 5.2 days (remote laboratories). Isolation findings: 75\% influenza positive not isolated; 69\% of isolated participants did not have influenza. For a cohort of 1000 participants, annual estimated non-diagnostic cost savings with NPT are \textbackslash pounds215,040. Conclusion This first prospective study of the Alere i NPT using throat swabs demonstrates high specificity, high PPV during seasonal epidemics, and rapid result availability which could lead to substantial cost savings.},

Methods 250 peoples' HES records were selected based on a HES recorded inpatient stay at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, a wider schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar affective disorder or unipolar depression. A gold-standard research diagnosis was made using Clinical Records Interactive Search pseudonymised electronic patient records using, and the OPCRIT+ algorithm.   Results Positive predictive value at the level of lifetime psychiatric disorder was 100\%, and at the level of lifetime diagnosis in the four categories of schizophrenia, wider schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar or unipolar depression was 73\% (68–79). Agreement varied by diagnosis, with schizophrenia having the highest PPV at 90\% (80–96). Each person had an average of five psychiatric HES records. An algorithm that looked at the last recorded psychiatric diagnosis led to greatest overall agreement with the research diagnosis.   Discussion For people who have a HES record from a psychiatric admission with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar affective disorder or unipolar depression, HES records appear to be a good indicator of a mental disorder, and can provide a diagnostic category with reasonable certainty. For these diagnoses, HES records can be an effective way of ascertaining psychiatric diagnosis.},

In the last years the stimulation of high frequency (HF) has been considered as a better alternative in this pathology for its supposed benefits compared to the stimulation with conventional frequency (CF). To compare in one year follow-up, the efficacy of high-frequency SCS (HF) versus conventional frequency SCS (CF) on the patients with FBSS. Design Prospective, Randomized blind trial. Setting Academic University Pain Medicine Center. Subject Seventy eight patients with FBSS diagnosis based on internationally recognized criteria, and refractory to conservative therapy for at least 6 months, have been initially recruited, and Methods Sixty subjects met the eligibility criteria and were randomized and scheduled for the trial phase.The patients were randomly assigned in either, one of the two groups: CF SCS or HF SCS. Within the study methods, special attention was paid to standardizing patient programming, so that these parameters would not impact the results.The trial period was considered successful if there was ?50\% reduction in the NRS from baseline. Results A total of 55 subjects successfully completed all assessments during one year follow-up. Change patterns in scores do not differ based on high versus conventional frequency, with significant global average reduction at 1 year similarly for both groups. Among all the items included in the Short Form-12 questionnaire (SF-12), only the variations in the social function score between the instants t1 and t2 are somewhat higher in the high frequency group. Conclusion The evolutionary pattern of the different parameters studied in our patients with FBSS does not differ according to their treatment by spinal stimulation, with conventional or high frequency, in one year follow-up.},

During the last decade there have been great advances in this imaging technique, partly as a result of improved scanner hardware, but more because of advances in microprocessor technology Coronary imaging is the ultimate challenge for any imaging technique. This is because the coronary arteries are small (2–4 mm in diameter) and have a tortuous, complex, three dimensional course and are continuously in motion, except for a short period during mid diastole.During the last decade we have witnessed great advances in cardiac imaging. This was partly as a result of improved scanner hardware, but more because of advances in microprocessor technology, which allow for rapid processing of extremely large quantities of data necessary for the acquisition, post-processing, and construction of hitherto unimaginable, non-invasively obtained images of the coronary lumen and plaque.This raises two important questions. Firstly, has progress in non-invasive coronary imaging techniques gone so far that conventional invasive diagnostic coronary angiography has become redundant? Secondly, are these new imaging techniques capable of detecting which coronary plaque is stable, unstable or vulnerable? Magnetic resonance coronary angiography (MR-CA), electron beam computed tomography (EBCT), and multi-slice computed tomography (MS-CT) have recently emerged as new non-invasive diagnostic techniques that possess the potential to replace conventional diagnostic angiography.1–4 The diagnostic accuracy to detect a significant coronary stenosis is presented in table 1. However, it should be noted that: firstly, the diagnostic value only concerns the detection of stenoses in the proximal and mid segment of the coronary tree, because the smaller distal segments cannot be adequately visualised; and secondly, only in 70–80 \% of these proximal and mid segments is image quality sufficient to allow a semiquantitative assessment.View this table:In this windowIn a new window Table 1 Approximate diagnostic value of non-invasive coronary imaging techniques to detect significant coronary stenosis (\&gt; 50 \% …},

Data over 1993-1998 were collected from (A) mandatory notifications (n = 2926); (B) hospital registration (n = 3968); (C) laboratory surveillance (n = 3484). As the standard capture-recapture method does not take into account false positive diagnoses, we developed a model to adjust for the lack of specificity of our sources. We estimated that 1363 cases were not registered in any of the three sources in the period of study. The completeness of the three sources was therefore estimated at 49\% for source A, 67\% for source B and 58\% for source C. After adjustment for false positive diagnoses, the completeness of source A, B, and C was estimated as 52\%, 70\% and 62\%, respectively. The capture-recapture methods offer an attractive approach to estimate the completeness of surveillance sources and hence contribute to a more accurate estimate of the disease burden under study. However, the method does not account for higher-order interactions or presence of false positive diagnoses. Being aware of these limitations, the capture-recapture method still elucidates the (in)completeness of sources and gives a rough estimate of this (in)completeness. This makes a more accurate monitoring of disease incidence possible and hence attributes to a more reliable foundation for the design and evaluation of health interventions such as vaccination programs.},

  abstract = {Objective: Foreign body response to indwelling cortical microelectrodes limits the reliability of neural stimulation and recording, particularly for extended chronic applications in behaving animals. The extent to which this response compromises the chronic stability of neural devices depends on many factors including the materials used in the electrode construction, the size, and geometry of the indwelling structure. Here, we report on the development of microelectrode arrays (MEAs) based on amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC). Approach: This technology utilizes a-SiC for its chronic stability and employs semiconductor manufacturing processes to create MEAs with small shank dimensions. The a-SiC films were deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and patterned by thin-film photolithographic techniques. To improve stimulation and recording capabilities with small contact areas, we investigated low impedance coatings on the electrode sites. The assembled devices were characterized in phosphate buffered saline for their electrochemical properties. Main results: MEAs utilizing a-SiC as both the primary structural element and encapsulation were fabricated successfully. These a-SiC MEAs had 16 penetrating shanks. Each shank has a cross-sectional area less than 60 µm2 and electrode sites with a geometric surface area varying from 20-200 µm2 . Electrode coatings of TiN and SIROF reduced 1 kHz electrode impedance to less than 100 kΩ from ∼2.8 MΩ for 100 µm2 Au electrode sites and increased the charge injection capacities to values greater than 3 mC/cm2 . Finally, we demonstrated functionality by recording neural activity from basal ganglia nucleus of Zebra Finches and motor cortex of rat. Significance: The a-SiC MEAs provide a significant advancement in the development of microelectrodes that over the years has relied on silicon platforms for device manufacture. These flexible a-SiC MEAs have the potential for decreased tissue damage and reduced foreign body response. The technique is promising and has potential for clinical translation and large scale manufacturing.},

The initial approach of the CALIBER programme is characterized as follows: (i) Linkages of multiple electronic heath record sources: examples include linkages between the longitudinal primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, the national registry of acute coronary syndromes (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project), hospitalization and procedure data from Hospital Episode Statistics and cause-specific mortality and social deprivation data from the Office of National Statistics. Current cohort analyses in-volve a million people in initially healthy populations and disease registries with \$10 5 patients. (ii) Linkages of bespoke investigator-led cohort studies (e.g. UK Biobank) to registry data (e.g. Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project), providing new means of ascertaining, validating and phenotyping disease. (iii) A common data model in which routine electronic health record data are made research ready, and sharable, by defining and curating with meta-data 4300 variables (categorical, continuous, event) on risk factors, CVDs and non-cardiovascular comorbidities. (iv) Transparency: all CALIBER studies have an analytic protocol registered in the public domain, and data are available (safe haven model) for use subject to approvals. For more information,},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Most clinical studies using photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical application of δ-aminolaevulinic acid (δ-ALA) use red light because it allows greater depth of penetration. However, given the porphyrin-like spectrum of δ-ALA-induced photosensitivity, violet light provides a maximal overlap with the excitation spectrum of protoporphyrin IX, meaning that PDT with violet light uses less light energy to induce the phototoxic reaction. Aim To study the efficacy of violet light in combination with topical δ-ALA PDT in the treatment of premalignant and malignant skin lesions. Methods Eight hours after 20\%δ-ALA was applied topically, photoirradiation was performed with an incoherent light source (Philips HPM-10, 400 W) emitting predominantly violet light (400–450 nm). Lesions received 10–20 J/cm2 during an exposure time of 30 min. The 38 subjects treated included three with basal cell naevus syndrome with multiple (¿ 30) superficial and nodular basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), one subject had multiple lesions of Bowen’s disease, involving 50\% of the scalp, and the remaining 34 subjects presented a total of 35 superficial BCCs, 10 nodular BCCs, four large solar keratoses and five solitary lesions of Bowen’s disease. Results Complete remission both clinically and histologically was seen after a single treatment in 82\% of the superficial BCCs (100\% after a second treatment), 50\% of the nodular BCCs, one of the four solar keratosis lesions (partial remission in the other three) and 90–100\% of the solitary lesions of Bowen’s disease. Conclusions δ-ALA PDT using violet light appears to be a well tolerated and effective alternative treatment for premalignant and malignant skin lesions, especially when there are multiple lesions or large patches comprising a large area of skin.},

Contaminants (baseline drift, flat line, QRS-artefact, spurious spikes, amplitude stepwise changes, noise) were detected on individual leads from joint time-frequency analysis and QRS amplitude. Classification was based on cascaded single-condition decision rules (SCDR) that tested levels of contaminants against classification thresholds. A supervised learning classifier (SLC) was implemented for comparison. The SCDR and SLC algorithms were trained on an annotated database (Set A, PhysioNet Challenge 2011) of 'acceptable' versus 'unacceptable' quality recordings using the 'leave M out' approach with repeated random partitioning and cross-validation. Two training approaches were considered: (i) balanced, in which training records had equal numbers of 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable' recordings, (ii) unbalanced, in which the ratio of 'acceptable' to 'unacceptable' recordings from Set A was preserved. For each training approach, thresholds were calculated, and classification accuracy of the algorithm compared to other rule based algorithms and the SLC using a database for which classifications were unknown (Set B PhysioNet Challenge 2011). The SCDR algorithm achieved the highest accuracy (91.40\%) compared to the SLC (90.40\%) in spite of its simple logic. It also offers the advantage that it facilitates reporting of meaningful causes of poor signal quality to users.},

Four methods were developed and assessed to determine the optimal PC: (1) power spectral distribution, (2) root mean square, (3) sample entropy, and (4) QRS template. The sensitivity of the performance of the algorithm to large-amplitude noise removal (by wavelet de-noising) and maternal beat cancellation methods were also assessed. The accuracy of maternal and fetal beat detection was assessed against reference annotations and quantified using the detection accuracy score F1 [2*PPV*Se / (PPV + Se)], sensitivity (Se), and positive predictive value (PPV). The best performing implementation was assessed on a test dataset of 100 recordings and the agreement between the computed and the reference fetal heart rate (fHR) and fetal RR (fRR) time series quantified.The best performance for detecting maternal beats (F1 99.3\%, Se 99.0\%, PPV 99.7\%) was obtained when using the QRS template method to select the optimal maternal PC and applying wavelet de-noising. The best performance for detecting fetal beats (F1 89.8\%, Se 89.3\%, PPV 90.5\%) was obtained when the optimal fetal PC was selected using the sample entropy method and utilising a fixed-length time window for the cancellation of the maternal beats. The performance on the test dataset was 142.7 beats(2)/min(2) for fHR and 19.9 ms for fRR, ranking respectively 14 and 17 (out of 29) when compared to the other algorithms presented at the Physionet Challenge 2013.},

  abstract = {Nailfold capillaroscopy is being increasingly used by rheumatologists in the diagnosis of SSc. However, assessment of all nailfolds can be time-consuming in a busy outpatient clinic. Our aim was to answer the question as to how many (and which) fingers a clinician should routinely assess to capture accurately the true state.A total of 2994 assessments (by an international panel of expert observers) of 1600 images from 173 participants (101 with SSc, 22 with primary RP and 50 healthy controls) were included in this analysis. Seven single-finger or finger combinations (derived from the middle and ring fingers) were then tested for sensitivity for the presence of two markers of capillary abnormality [presence of giant capillaries and an SSc grade (early, active or late)] compared with assessment of all eight fingers.For the eight-finger gold standard, sensitivity against the diagnostic criteria was 74.6\% (53.0\% for the presence of giants alone and 73.1\% for image grade alone). Examining only one finger gave low sensitivity (ranging from right middle 31.7\% to left ring 46.6\%). Examining both ring fingers gave a sensitivity of 59.8\%, whereas examining the four-finger combination of both ring and both middle fingers gave a sensitivity of 66.7\%.During routine capillaroscopic examination, ideally all eight nailbeds (excluding thumbs) should be examined, otherwise some abnormalities will be missed. Examining only four fingers reduces capillaroscopy sensitivity.},

The secondary analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (transfemoral or transapical approaches) (SAPIEN heart valve) compared with surgical aortic valve replacement in operable patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. METHODS: A combined decision tree and Markov model was developed to compare costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years over a 20-year time horizon from the Canadian health-care payer perspective. The Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves trial provided rates of postoperative complications and mortality. Costs were derived from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of uncertainty on the cost-effective estimates. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, comparing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation and standard management resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of \$36,458/life-year and \$51,324/quality-adjusted life-year. In the secondary analysis, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (transfemoral or transapical) and surgical aortic valve replacement were compared, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \$870,143/life-year and transcatheter aortic valve implantation being dominated by surgical aortic valve replacement when comparing quality-adjusted life-years. Deterministic sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis identified the procedural costs and 1-year mortality rates of both transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation and standard management to be the most sensitive parameters in the model, whereas results from the secondary analysis were largely unchanged. Removal of long-term complications in both analyses led to more favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for transcatheter aortic valve implantation. CONCLUSIONS: This economic evaluation suggested that transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation was a cost-effective option compared with standard management for inoperable patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis, but it might not be a cost-effective treatment compared with surgical aortic valve replacement for operable patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare the hazards of cigarette smoking in men who formed their habits at different periods, and the extent of the reduction in risk when cigarette smoking is stopped at different ages. DESIGN Prospective study that has continued from 1951 to 2001. SETTING United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS 34 439 male British doctors. Information about their smoking habits was obtained in 1951, and periodically thereafter; cause specific mortality was monitored for 50 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Overall mortality by smoking habit, considering separately men born in different periods. RESULTS The excess mortality associated with smoking chiefly involved vascular, neoplastic, and respiratory diseases that can be caused by smoking. Men born in 1900-1930 who smoked only cigarettes and continued smoking died on average about 10 years younger than lifelong non-smokers. Cessation at age 60, 50, 40, or 30 years gained, respectively, about 3, 6, 9, or 10 years of life expectancy. The excess mortality associated with cigarette smoking was less for men born in the 19th century and was greatest for men born in the 1920s. The cigarette smoker versus non-smoker probabilities of dying in middle age (35-69) were 42\% nu 24\% (a twofold death rate ratio) for those born in 1900-1909, but were 43\% nu 15\% (a threefold death rate ratio) for those born in the 1920s. At older ages, the cigarette smoker versus non-smoker probabilities of surviving from age 70 to 90 were 10\% nu 12\% at the death rates of the 1950s (that is, among men born around the 1870s) but were 7\% nu 33\% (again a threefold death rate ratio) at the death rates of the 1990s (that is, among men born around the 1910s). CONCLUSION A substantial progressive decrease in the mortality rates among non-smokers over the past half century (due to prevention and improved treatment of disease) has been wholly outweighed, among cigarette smokers, by a progressive increase in the smoker nu non-smoker death rate ratio due to earlier and more intensive use of cigarettes. Among the men born around 1920, prolonged cigarette smoking from early adult life tripled age specific mortality rates, but cessation at age 50 halved the hazard, and cessation at age 30 avoided almost all of it.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Forecasting can support rational decision-making around the introduction and use of emerging health technologies and prevent investment in technologies that have limited long-term potential. However, forecasting methods need to be credible. We performed a systematic search to identify the methods used in forecasting studies to predict future health technologies within a 3-20-year timeframe. Identification and retrospective assessment of such methods potentially offer a route to more reliable prediction. DESIGN: Systematic search of the literature to identify studies reported on methods of forecasting in healthcare. PARTICIPANTS: People are not needed in this study. DATA SOURCES: The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and grey literature sources, and included articles published in English that reported their methods and a list of identified technologies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Studies reporting methods used to predict future health technologies within a 3-20-year timeframe with an identified list of individual healthcare technologies. Commercially sponsored reviews, long-term futurology studies (with over 20-year timeframes) and speculative editorials were excluded. RESULTS: 15 studies met our inclusion criteria. Our results showed that the majority of studies (13/15) consulted experts either alone or in combination with other methods such as literature searching. Only 2 studies used more complex forecasting tools such as scenario building. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological fundamentals of formal 3-20-year prediction are consistent but vary in details. Further research needs to be conducted to ascertain if the predictions made were accurate and whether accuracy varies by the methods used or by the types of technologies identified.},

We investigated whether three countries that expanded their data systems to include more secondary diagnosis fields showed increased PSI rates compared with six countries that did not. Furthermore, administrative hospital data from six of these countries and two American states, California (2011) and Florida (2010), were analysed for distributions of coded patient safety events across diagnosis fields. RESULTS: /st\textbackslash textgreaterAmong the participating countries, increasing the number of diagnosis fields was not associated with any overall increase in PSI rates. However, high proportions of PSI-related diagnoses appeared beyond the sixth secondary diagnosis field. The distribution of three PSI-related ICD codes was similar in California and Florida: 89-90\% of central venous catheter infections and 97-99\% of retained foreign bodies and accidental punctures or lacerations were captured within 15 secondary diagnosis fields. CONCLUSIONS: /st\textbackslash textgreaterSix to nine secondary diagnosis fields are inadequate for comparing complication rates using hospital administrative data; at least 15 (and perhaps more with ICD-11) are recommended to fully characterize clinical outcomes. Increasing the number of fields should improve the international and intra-national comparability of data for epidemiologic and health services research, utilization analyses and quality of care assessment.},

As far back as 1974 Williams listed the essential elements of economic evaluations, and more recently Drummond and colleagues set out the methodological areas generally agreed among economists. Guidelines for economic evaluations have been promulgated and reviewed by many bodies but few medical journals have explicit guidelines for peer review of economic evaluations or consistently use economist reviewers for economic papers even though they are a major publication outlet for economic evaluations. In January 1995 the BMJ set up a working party on economic evaluation to improve the quality of submitted and published economic articles. It was not our intention to be unduly prescriptive or stifle innovative methods; our emphasis is on improving the clarity of economic evaluations. We also did not address those issues of conduct that have been emphasised in other guidelines},

Results are compared with the outputs of standard radiation environment models.

In this paper the success of a number of calculations in predicting a variety of effects will be examined. The calculation techniques include Monte Carlo transport codes and semi-empirical fragmentation calculations. Observations are based on flights of the Cosmic Radiation Environment and Activation Monitor at a number of inclinations and altitudes on Space Shuttle. The Shuttle experiments included an active cosmic-ray detector as well as metal activation foils and passive detector crystals of sodium iodide which were counted for induced radioactivity soon after return to earth. Results show that cosmic-ray secondaries increase the fluxes of particles of linear energy transfer less than 200 MeV/(gm cm-2), while the activation of the crystals is enhanced by about a factor of three due to secondary neutrons. Detailed spectra of induced radioactivity resulting from spallation products have been obtained. More than a hundred significant radioactive nuclides are included in the calculation and overall close agreement with the observations is obtained.},

On both occasions the instrument observed an excess of counts due to protons of greater than 30 MeV in energy in the region off of South Africa where field lines of L=2.5 intersect low earth orbit. Meanwhile the Cosmic Radiation Environment and Dosimetry Experiment (CREDO) carried to 840 km, 98.7 degrees orbit on UOSAT-3 has continued to sample the high field portions of the L-shells around L = 2.5 from April 1990 until the present time. When careful subtraction of cosmic-ray contributions is made it can be seen that the March 91 enhancement persisted for approximately 8 months and explains the STS-48 observation. There would appear to have been a further increase produced by the 31 October 1992 flare event and seen by STS-53.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Establishing intravenous access is often vital in an acute hospital setting but can be difficult. Ultrasound-guided cannulation increases success rates in prospective studies. However, these studies have often lacked a comparative group. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness of Ultrasound-guided peripheral intravenous cannulation compared with the standard technique in patients known to have difficult access. METHODS: Electronic abstract databases, trial registries, article reference lists and internet repositories were searched using the following search terms: 'peripheral venous cannulation', 'peripheral venous access'. Studies meeting the following criteria were included: randomised controlled trial patients of all ages who required peripheral intravenous access; interventions were Ultrasound-guided versus standard cannulation technique; patients were identified as having difficult venous access; inclusion of at least one defined outcome (procedural success time to cannula placement; number of attempts). RESULTS: 7 trials were identified (289 participants). Ultrasound guidance increases the likelihood of successful cannulation (pooled OR 2.42; 95\% CI 1.26 to 4.68; p=0.008). There were no differences in time to successful cannulation, or number of percutaneous skin punctures. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound guidance increases the likelihood of successful peripheral cannulation in difficult access patients. We recommend its use in patients who have difficult venous access, and have failed venous cannulation by standard methods. Further randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with larger sample sizes would be of benefit to investigate if Ultrasound has any additional advantages in terms of reducing the procedure time and the number of skin punctures required for successful venous cannulation.},

Data for parent and teacher ratings in a clinical sample are presented along with various measures of reliability and validity. Optimal cutoff scores were estimated, using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. Findings indicate that the ASSQ is a useful brief screening device for the identification of autism spectrum disorders in clinical settings.},

Fundamental questions remain about the physiologic effects and safety of DBS. Previous basic research studies have focused on the direct polarization of neuronal membranes by electrical stimulation. The goal of this paper is to provide information on the thermal effects of DBS using finite element models to investigate the magnitude and spatial distribution of DBS induced temperature changes. The parameters investigated include: stimulation waveform, lead selection, brain tissue electrical and thermal conductivity, blood perfusion, metabolic heat generation during the stimulation. Our results show that clinical deep brain stimulation protocols will increase the temperature of surrounding tissue by up to 0.8 deg C depending on stimulation/tissue parameters.},

  abstract = {It has recently been suggested that sonophoresis, or the application of ultrasound (US) in the kilohertz range, could enhance peritoneal mass transport. To examine this hypothesis, six nephrectomized rabbits were exposed to ultrasound while under isoflurane anesthesia. An additional five also had bilateral nephrectomies and were used as a control group. Each group underwent four exchanges of 90 minutes duration with 1.5\% dextrose while anesthetized. Dialysate samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, and 90 minutes and assayed for urea, creatinine, glucose, and protein. Blood samples were taken pre- and postexchange. In the US group, 20 kHz ultrasound was applied during exchanges 2 and 3 at 47.5 W and 95 W, respectively, using a Virsonic 475 cell disrupter acoustically coupled to the abdomen through a water column and gel-coated PVC membrane. Results were analyzed by calculating the mass transfer area coefficient (MTAC) and 90-minute D/P values for each exchange. No significant differences were observed in the absolute means of either parameter between the control and US groups. However when exchanges 2 to 4 were normalized with respect to exchange 1, the resulting urea D/P means were less for the US exchanges compared to the control (p \textbackslash textless 0.05). This suggests a possible decrease in transport through US application.},

Computational neuroscientists have developed biologically-inspired models of visual attention, termed saliency maps, which successfully predict where people fixate on average. Using point process theory for spatial statistics, we show that scanpaths contain, however, important statistical structure, such as spatial clustering on top of distributions of gaze positions. Here we develop a dynamical model of saccadic selection that accurately predicts the distribution of gaze positions as well as spatial clustering along individual scanpaths. Our model relies on, first, activation dynamics via spatially-limited (foveated) access to saliency information, and, second, a leaky memory process controlling the re-inspection of target regions. This theoretical framework models a form of context-dependent decision-making, linking neural dynamics of attention to behavioral gaze data.},

  abstract = {An estimated 15\% of patients with diabetes will develop a foot ulcer sometime in their life, making them 30 to 40 times more likely to undergo amputation due to a non-healing foot ulcer than the non-diabetic population. To determine the safety and efficacy of a new, non-contact, kilohertz ultrasound therapy for the healing of recalcitrant diabetic foot ulcers - as well as to evaluate the impact on total closure and quantitative bacterial cultures and the effect on healing of various levels of sharp/surgical debridement - a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled, multicenter study was conducted in hospital-based and private wound care clinics. Patients (55 met criteria for efficacy analysis) received standard of care, which included products that provide a moist environment, offloading diabetic shoes and socks, debridement, wound evaluation, and measurement. The “therapy\{”\} was either active 40 KHz ultrasound delivered by a saline mist or a “sham device\{”\} which delivered a saline mist without, the use of ultrasound. After 12 weeks of care, the proportion of wounds healed (defined as complete epithelialization without drainage) in the active ultrasound therapy device group was significantly higher than that in the sham control group (40.7\% versus 14.3\%, P = 0.0366, Fishers exact test). The ultrasound treatment was easy to use and no difference in the number and type of adverse events between the two treatment groups was noted. Of interest, wounds were debrided at baseline followed by a quantitative culture biopsy. The results of these cultures demonstrated a significant bioburden (\textbackslash textgreater 10(5)) in the majority of cases, despite a lack of clinical signs of infection. Compared to control, this therapeutic modality was found to increase the healing rate of recalcitrant, diabetic foot ulcers.},

  abstract = {Mitral valve surgery has changed considerably in the past decades and is now indicated mostly for pure or predominant mitral regurgitation. This is the result of the regression of rheumatic disease, of the efficacy of mitral balloon valvuloplasty for mitral stenosis, and of the aging of the population with increasing degenerative or ischaemic disease causing mitral regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation can be “organic” (that is, caused by intrinsic mitral disease such as rheumatic disease, ruptured chord, perforation of leaflet) or be “functional” (that is, where a normal valve regurgitates because of ventricular dysfunction).The timing of mitral surgery has remained one of the most vexing problems of clinical cardiology because symptoms can remain absent or minimal despite severe regurgitation caused by adaptive remodelling of left ventricle and atrium, or because of patient adaptation to the disease. However, recent advances in the understanding of the natural history of the disease and of the impact of left ventricular dysfunction on outcome, in the echocardiographic evaluation of mitral diseases and in the risk and success of mitral repair, have resulted in a widespread evolution towards earlier surgery. Mitral regurgitation is a progressive disease The new quantitative techniques have allowed the progression of mitral regurgitation to be defined. As was clinically suspected, mitral regurgitation is a progressive disease,1 with an increase on average of 7.5 ml per year for regurgitant volume and of 5.9 mm2 per year for the effective regurgitant orifice. The determinants of progression are anatomic changes, with more rapid progression in patients with mitral valve prolapse, in particular new flail leaflet, and in patients with an enlarging mitral annulus.1 Importantly, progression is not uniform and if half of the patients see notable progression, 11\% see also spontaneous regression of mitral regurgitation, related to improved loading conditions. The progression of mitral regurgitation also causes progression of …},

  abstract = {Babies weighing under 6 kg are difficult to dialyse, especially those as small as 1 kg. Peritoneal dialysis is easier than haemodialysis, but is not always possible, and clears molecules less efficiently. Two factors complicate haemodialysis. First, extracorporeal circuits are large relative to a baby's blood volume, necessitating priming with fresh or modified blood. Second, blood flow from infants' access vessels is disproportionately low (Poiseuille's law), causing inadequate dialysis, or clotting within the circuit. These problems are minimised by using single lumen access, a very small circuit, and a reservoir syringe to separate the sampling and dialyser blood flow rates. Its manual operation is tedious, so we developed a computer-controlled, pressure-monitored machine to run it, including adjusting the blood withdrawal rate from poorly sampling lines. We have dialysed four babies weighing 0.8-3.4 kg, with renal failure or metabolic disorders. The circuits did not require priming. Clearances of creatinine, urea, potassium, phosphate and ammonia were mean (SD) 0.54 (0.22) ml/min using one dialyser, and 0.98 (0.22) ml/min using two in parallel. Ammonia clearance in a 2.4 kg baby had a 9 h half-life. Ultrafiltration up to 45 ml/h was achieved easily. This device provided infants with immediate, effective and convenient haemodialysis, typically delivered for prolonged periods.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Teachers seem to be vulnerable to voice disorders because of excessive use of their voice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a voice education program on the Vocal Handicap Index (VHI) scores of elementary school teachers in the Persian education system. METHOD: This was a semi-experimental study, performed in Shiraz public schools. Ten schools were selected on their similarity in number of students and teachers, and allocated at random to training or control groups. Sixty-one teachers in the training group and 66 teachers in the control group completed the VHI in the first week. Teachers in the trained group received voice education for 4 weeks, and then continued to follow the program for a further 4 weeks. The control group received no training. After 8 weeks, all subjects completed the questionnaire again. RESULTS: Compliance was good for all practices except "breathing exercises" and "using amplifiers" where it was exceptionally poor. Teachers in the training group improved significantly in total VHI score (from 14.2 to 6.8), whereas the control group showed a significant worsening (from 10.1 to 13.7). These effects were significant (P \textbackslash textless 0.05) for total VHI score and for all subscales. The corresponding effect sizes for the training group range from -0.53 to -0.84 (-0.83 in the overall VHI). CONCLUSION: A voice education program can have positive effects on the voice of teachers, even without dysphonia, in the middle of their teaching. Such a program may have a place in the Persian education system.},

  abstract = {Eye tracking has the potential to characterize autism at a unique intermediate level, with links 'down' to underlying neurocognitive networks, as well as 'up' to everyday function and dysfunction. Because it is non-invasive and does not require advanced motor responses or language, eye tracking is particularly important for the study of young children and infants. In this article, we review eye tracking studies of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and children at risk for ASD. Reduced looking time at people and faces, as well as problems with disengagement of attention, appear to be among the earliest signs of ASD, emerging during the first year of life. In toddlers with ASD, altered looking patterns across facial parts such as the eyes and mouth have been found, together with limited orienting to biological motion. We provide a detailed discussion of these and other key findings and highlight methodological opportunities and challenges for eye tracking research of young children with ASD. We conclude that eye tracking can reveal important features of the complex picture of autism.},

Study design Using near-infrared spectroscopy, changes in cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb), dexoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), and tissue oxygenation index (TOI) were measured during the first 15 minutes of life in 20 healthy newborn infants delivered at term by elective cesarean section. Results O2Hb and TOI increased rapidly within the first minutes of life (median slope for O2Hb, 3.4 μmol/L/min; range, 1.4 to 20.6 μmol/L/min; median slope for TOI, 4.2 \%/min; range, -0.4 to 27.3\%/min), and cerebral HHb decreased (median slope, -4.8 μmol/L/min; range, -0.2 to -20.6 μmol/L/min). O2Hb, TOI, and HHb all reached a plateau within 8 minutes. Conclusions A significant increase in cerebral O2Hb and TOI and a significant decrease in HHb occur during immediate adaptation in healthy term newborns, reaching a steady plateau at around 8 minutes after birth.},

  abstract = {Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a complex and expensive technology that can be used to provide temporary support during respiratory failure. Its value for mature newborn infants is controversial because of varying interpretation of the available evidence. We undertook a collaborative trial throughout the UK to assess whether a policy of referral for ECMO has a beneficial effect on survival to 1 year without severe disability in comparison with conventional management. Methods: Between 1993 and 1995, 185 mature (gestational age at birth ≤ 35 weeks, birthweight ≤ 2 kg) newborn infants with severe respiratory failure (oxygenation index ≤ 40) were enrolled from 55 hospitals in a randomised comparison of either referral to one of five specialist centres for consideration of ECMO or continued intensive conventional management at the original hospital. The most common diagnoses were persistent pulmonary hypertension due to meconium aspiration, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, isolated persistent fetal circulation, sepsis, and idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. Of the infants allocated ECMO, 84\% received this support. Recruitment to the trial was stopped early (November, 1995) by the trial steering committee on the advice of the independent data-monitoring committee, because the data accumulated showed a clear advantage with ECMO. 124 children were enrolled before December, 1994; those who survived to 1 year of age have undergone neurological assessment at that age (by one of three developmental paediatricians unaware of treatment allocation). Findings: Overall, 81 (44\%) infants died before leaving hospital, and two are known to have died later. Death rates differed between the two trial groups; 30 of 93 infants allocated ECMO died compared with 54 of 92 allocated conventional care. The relative risk was 0.55 (95\% CI 0.39-0.77; p = 0.0005), which is equivalent to one extra survivor for every three to four infants allocated ECMO. The difference in survival applied irrespective of the primary diagnosis, disease severity, and type of referral centre. The benefit of ECMO was also found for the primary outcome measure of death or disability at 1 year (among 124 children enrolled before December, 1994). One child in each group has severe disability (overall Griffiths' developmental quotient \textbackslash textless 50, or untestable), and 16 (ten ECMO, six conventional management) have impairments with a lesser degree of disability. Interpretation: These preliminary results demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of a well-staffed and organised neonatal ECMO service. ECMO support should be actively considered for neonates with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background: Varying amounts of data related to cancer diagnosis, treatment and/or outcome are routinely collected by many disparate groups. Routinely combining data from these sources could improve data quality and utility for audit and research purposes. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the benefits of linkage between oncology databases. Methods: We examined colorectal cancer (CRC) data recorded by the Victorian Cancer Registry and two hospital clinical databases between January 2000 and December 2005. Where data were in common, the completeness and accuracy of each dataset were examined. Where content differed, the potential value of making this additional data available to the other database was examined. Results: Of the 831 cases recorded at the hospitals, 822 (98.9\%) were also recorded on the cancer registry. Eight of the 913 cases (0.87\%) recorded as having CRC by the registry did not have CRC. Errors in recording of tumour site and tumour or nodal stage were frequent in both databases. Metastasis stage was recorded in only 29 of 822 (3.5\%) registry cases examined. Discordance for diagnosis date and death date was also frequent, although the difference was typically minor. Adding additional death data from the registry to the clinical database significantly altered stage-specific and overall survival figures. Conclusion: A multidirectional flow of data between hospital and registry databases provides multiple opportunities to improve data quality and utility. While issues around data ownership and usage need to be considered, the advantages of routine data linkage are readily apparent.},

The cytoskeleton, which consists of different components, is considered to be important for maintaining cell shape and facilitating cell movement. Numerous data are available about tumor cell motility in vitro, but the behavior of tumor cells in vivo is as yet poorly understood. In the present study, estimates of tumor cell motility and proliferation were statistically derived from morphological tumor patterns in human melanocytic skin tumors, and their relationship to expression of certain cytoskeletal components was evaluated. Over-expression of vimentin within tumor cells correlated with low actual tumor cell motility and proliferation, indicating a structurally stabilizing function of these filaments. An overexpression of actin was found within tumor cells of high motility and proliferation, suggesting the contribution of cytocontractile elements to active tumor cell locomotion in situ. Concerning the cytoskeleton of the stromal cells, expression of actin, myosin and tubulin correlated with a high number of motile tumor cells and high mitotic counts. Thus increased tumor cell motility seems to be associated with cytoskeletal changes not only of the tumor cells themselves but also of the surrounding stromal cells. Fink-Puches R, Smolle J.

The degree of this 'change blindness', however, varies with the content of the scene: when an object is semantically important or contextually inappropriate, people may be more effective at detecting changes. Two experiments investigated change blindness in people with autism, who are known from previous research to be efficient in detecting features yet poor at processing stimuli for meaning and context. The first experiment measured the effect of semantic information while the second investigated the role of context in directing attention. In each task, participants detected the dissimilarity between pairs of images. Both groups showed a main effect of image type in both experimental tasks, showing that their attention was directed to semantically meaningful and contextually inappropriate items. However, the autistic group also showed a greater difficulty detecting changes to semantically marginal items in the first experiment. Conclusions point to a normal selection of items for attention in people with autism spectrum disorders, although this may be combined with difficulty switching or disengaging attention.},

We investigated whether young adults would detect a change to the direction of eye-gaze in another's face more efficiently than a control change (presence/absence of spectacles). A change blindness method was used in which images showed faces as part of a complex, naturalistic scene. Results showed that adults with ASD, like typically developing controls, were faster and more accurate at detecting eye-gaze than control changes. Results are considered in terms of a developmental account of the relationship between social attention and other skills.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition in which children show reduced attention to social aspects of the environment. However in adults with ASD, evidence for social attentional deficits is equivocal. One problem is that many paradigms present social information in an unrealistic, isolated way. This study presented adults and adolescents, with and without ASD, with a complex social scene alongside another, non-social scene, and measured eye-movements during a 3-s viewing period. Analyses first identified viewing time to different regions and then investigated some more complex issues. These were: the location of the very first fixation in a trial (indicating attentional priority); the effect of a task instruction on scan paths; the extent to which gaze-following was evident; and the degree to which participants' scan paths were influenced by the low-level properties of a scene. Results indicate a superficially normal attentional preference for social information in adults with ASD. However, more sensitive measures show that ASD does entail social attention problems across the lifespan, supporting accounts of the disorder which emphasise lifelong neurodevelopmental atypicalities. These subtle abnormalities may be sufficient to produce serious difficulties in real-life scenarios. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {AIM To compare the immediate and late outcomes of patients treated by a policy of routine stent implantation with routine balloon angioplasty and the use of stents only when an ideal result has not been obtained. METHODS A nine centre, multinational, randomised study of 300 patients with coronary artery disease thought suitable for treatment of a single lesion by balloon angioplasty or stent implantation. Only new lesions in patients who had not undergone previous bypass surgery were included, and totally occluded vessels were excluded. RESULTS The initial procedure was considered successful in 96\% of patients. There was more complete angiographic restoration of luminal diameter in patients treated by elective stent (minimum lumen diameter (MLD) 2.68 mm for stentv 2.27 mm for balloon; p\,\&lt;\,0.007), but analysis of the subgroup of balloon angioplasty patients who crossed over to stenting showed that they achieved similar results to the elective stent group. Late luminal loss was greater in stented patients than in those undergoing balloon angioplasty only, and by six months the angiographic benefit of stenting had disappeared (MLD 1.90 mm for stent group v 2.00\,mm for balloon angioplasty). Angiographic and clinical results in the balloon angioplasty group were assisted by the high crossover rate (30.1\%). Both groups had similar symptom relief, with 58.9\% of patients improving by two or more angina grades. The need for further revascularisation was also similar in the two groups at one year (18.2\% in the stented group v 17.1\% in the balloon angioplasty group). Haemorrhagic complications at the local arterial entry site were more common than expected and were distributed equally between the patients receiving full anticoagulation and those receiving antiplatelet treatment only. The results of both Wiktor stent placement and balloon angioplasty were similar to the findings in the stent group in previous randomised studies (Benestent II, STRESS). CONCLUSIONS Provisional stenting appears to offer the same longer term outcome as elective stenting in this selected group of patients. Improvement in the results of conventional balloon angioplasty in the past 10 years means that a policy of obtaining an ideal result without the use of stents appears to be practicable in many of these patients, with consequent cost savings.},

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) combined with instillation for patients either presenting with a complex wound or after failure of classic NPWT. Method: A retrospective case series study conducted on patients treated using an NPWT instillation system (V.A.C. Instill; KCI Inc.) from January to December 2012. The instillation machine was used with pure saline so as not to interfere with local antibacterial solutions. Two clinical indications?patients presenting either large undermining, deep inaccessible wounds or infected wounds and those for whom conventional NPWT had proved ineffective, were analysed?with efficacy of the promotion of granulation tissue as the primary outcome. length of instillation time, the rhythm and the amount of liquid to be injected compared with the estimated volume of the cavity were also evaluated. Results: Twenty-four patients were included in this series?12 post-NPWT failures and 12 complex wounds?with positive outcomes in 23 cases. Surgical closure was realised after promotion of granulation tissue, using either flaps or skin grafts alone, or combined with previous application of a dermal substitute. No complications linked to instillation were observed during the period of use. Conclusion: The results of this case series suggests that use of NPWT combined with pure saline instillation could have a positive impact on the healing trajectory of patients with complex wounds or after failure of classic NPWT.

  abstract = {Optogenetics is a research field that uses gene therapy to deliver a gene encoding a light-activated protein to cells providing light-regulated control of targeted cell pathways. The technology is a popular tool in many fields of neuroscience, used to transiently switch cells on and off, for example, to map neural circuits. In inherited retinal degenerative diseases, where loss of vision results from the loss of photoreceptors, optogenetics can be applied to either augment the function of surviving photoreceptors or confer light sensitivity to naturally nonlight sensitive retinal cells, such as a bipolar cells. This can be achieved either by the light sensitive protein integrating with native internal signaling pathways, or by using a dual function membrane protein that integrates light signaling with an ion channel or pump activity. Exposing treated cells to light of the correct wavelength activates the protein, resulting in cellular depolarization or hyperpolarization that triggers neurological signaling to the visual cortex. While there is a lot of interest in optogenetics as a pan-disease clinical treatment for end-stage application in the inherited degenerative diseases of the retina, research to date has been limited to nonhuman clinical studies. To address the clinical translational needs of this technology, the Foundation Fighting Blindness and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary cohosted an International Optogenetic Therapies for Vision Workshop, which was held at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, Massachusetts on June 1, 2012.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) imaging of the heart is a rapidly developing area of research in medical imaging. Advances in hardware and methods for fast spatio-temporal cardiac imaging are extending the frontiers of clinical diagnosis and research on cardiovascular diseases. In the last few years, many approaches have been proposed to analyze images and extract parameters of cardiac shape and function from a variety of cardiac imaging modalities. In particular, techniques based on spatio-temporal geometric models have received considerable attention. This paper surveys the literature of two decades of research on cardiac modeling. The contribution of the paper is three-fold: 1) to serve as a tutorial of the field for both clinicians and technologists, 2) to provide an extensive account of modeling techniques in a comprehensive and systematic manner, and 3) to critically review these approaches in terms of their performance and degree of clinical evaluation with respect to the final goal of cardiac functional analysis. From this review it is concluded that whereas 3-D model-based approaches have the capability to improve the diagnostic value of cardiac images, issues as robustness, 3-D interaction, computational complexity and clinical validation still require significant attention.},

Giving physicians access to this information supplements the peer-reviewed scientific literature and might be essential for comparing alternative devices within any class. Interested patients should be encouraged to review the evidence for any device that has been recommended for them. The new EU law on medical devices states that the manufacturer is to prepare a summary of the evidence for any implantable or high-risk device. Defining its content, however, has been delegated to implementing legislation, which is now being considered. From a clinical perspective, it is imperative that all evidence reviewed by notified bodies and regulatory authorities is disclosed—with the exception, if justified, only of technical specifications that are considered confidential or manufacturing details that are protected as intellectual property—and public access to this evidence must be guaranteed by EU law. From ethical and other perspectives, there are no grounds for less clinical evidence being available to health-care professionals about the medical devices that they use than is already available for new pharmaceutical products. Full transparency is needed; without it, informed decisions relating to the use of new medical devices will remain impossible.},

A novel computerized image manipulation program presented a series of photographic scenes, each containing a person. The program enabled participants to laterally maneuver the scenes behind a static window, the borders of which partially occluded the scenes. The gaze direction of the person in the scenes spontaneously cued attention of both groups in the direction of gaze, affecting judgments of preference (Experiment 1a) and causing memory biases (Experiment 1b). Experiment 2 showed that the gaze direction of a person cues visual search accurately to the exact location of gaze in both groups. These findings suggest that biases in preference, memory, and attention are caused by another person's gaze direction when viewed in a complex scene in adolescents with and without ASD.},

Twenty-four high-functioning adolescents (aged 11-16) with ASD and 24 typically developing matched control participants viewed and then described a series of scenes, each containing a person. Analyses of eye movements and verbal descriptions provided converging evidence that both groups displayed general interest in the person in each scene but the salience of the person was reduced for the ASD participants. Nevertheless, the verbal descriptions revealed that participants with ASD frequently processed the observed person's emotion or mental state without prompting. They also often mentioned eye-gaze direction, and there was evidence from eye movements and verbal descriptions that gaze was followed accurately. The combination of evidence from eye movements and verbal descriptions provides a rich insight into the way stimuli are processed overall. The merits of using these methods within the same paradigm are discussed.},

  abstract = {It is widely reported that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) direct their attention in an atypical manner. When viewing complex scenes, typically developing individuals look at social aspects of scenes more rapidly than individuals with ASD. In the absence of a strong drive to extract social information, is something else capturing attention in these initial fixations, such as visually salient features? Twenty four high-functioning adolescents with ASD and 24 typically developing matched control participants viewed a series of indoor and outdoor scenes while their eye movements were tracked. Participants in both groups were more likely to fixate on salient regions in the first five fixations than later in viewing. Peak saliency at fixation occurred at fixation two for the typically developing participants but at fixation three for ASD participants. This difference was driven by typically developing participants looking at heads earlier than ASD participants–which are often visually salient. No differences between groups were observed for images in which the heads were not salient. We can therefore conclude that visual saliency impacts fixation location in a similar manner in individuals with ASD and those with typical development. It was found that social features in scenes (heads) captured attention much more than visually salient features, even in individuals with ASD.},

  abstract = {Social understanding is facilitated by effectively attending to other people and the subtle social cues they generate. In order to more fully appreciate the nature of social attention and what drives people to attend to social aspects of the world, one must investigate the factors that influence social attention. This is especially important when attempting to create models of disordered social attention, e.g. a model of social attention in autism. Here we analysed participants' viewing behaviour during one-to-one social interactions with an experimenter. Interactions were conducted either live or via video (social presence manipulation). The participant was asked and then required to answer questions. Experimenter eye-contact was either direct or averted. Additionally, the influence of participant self-reported autistic traits was also investigated. We found that regardless of whether the interaction was conducted live or via a video, participants frequently looked at the experimenter's face, and they did this more often when being asked a question than when answering. Critical differences in social attention between the live and video interactions were also observed. Modifications of experimenter eye contact influenced participants' eye movements in the live interaction only; and increased autistic traits were associated with less looking at the experimenter for video interactions only. We conclude that analysing patterns of eye-movements in response to strictly controlled video stimuli and natural real-world stimuli furthers the field's understanding of the factors that influence social attention.},

While developing an international multicentre study to evaluate efficacy of airway stents, it was realised that no adequate description of central airway stenosis regarding type, location and degree has been published. Thus, comparing results of different treatment modalities in different centres has been difficult due to a lack of uniformity of classification. Reports are typically descriptive and precise classification schemes have not adequately addressed either for the trachea or the main bronchi. A standardised classification scheme was proposed with descriptive images and diagrams for rapid and uniform classification of central airway stenosis. The present authors' system divides stenosis into structural and dynamic types and further classifies the disease by degree of stenosis, location and transition zone. Multiple sites can be described and each is transformed into a simple numerical scoring system prompted by a diagram, which can be easily captured for subsequent uniform analysis across sites. A pilot validation of the system, with 18 pulmonologists of varying training background, showed strong precision and agreement between observers. Such a system will enhance the ability to study the effectiveness of treatment modalities for central airway stenosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical effect of routine intracoronary thrombus aspiration before primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is uncertain. We aimed to evaluate whether thrombus aspiration reduces mortality. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial, with enrollment of patients from the national comprehensive Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) and end points evaluated through national registries. A total of 7244 patients with STEMI undergoing PCI were randomly assigned to manual thrombus aspiration followed by PCI or to PCI only. The primary end point was all-cause mortality at 30 days. RESULTS: No patients were lost to follow-up. Death from any cause occurred in 2.8\% of the patients in the thrombus-aspiration group (103 of 3621), as compared with 3.0\% in the PCI-only group (110 of 3623) (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.22; P=0.63). The rates of hospitalization for recurrent myocardial infarction at 30 days were 0.5\% and 0.9\% in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.34 to 1.07; P=0.09), and the rates of stent thrombosis were 0.2\% and 0.5\%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.20 to 1.02; P=0.06). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to the rate of stroke or neurologic complications at the time of discharge (P=0.87). The results were consistent across all major prespecified subgroups, including subgroups defined according to thrombus burden and coronary flow before PCI. CONCLUSIONS: Routine thrombus aspiration before PCI as compared with PCI alone did not reduce 30-day mortality among patients with STEMI.

Whether AKI has a causal relationship with subsequent mortality or whether the development of AKI simply occurs in patients with more comorbidity undergoing more complex procedures remains unresolved. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was an observational cohort study of prospectively collected data from 4694 patients discharged from the hospital after first-time CABG surgery at a tertiary cardiac center between 2003 and 2008. AKI was defined using the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End stage (RIFLE) criteria, which require at least a 50\% increase in serum creatinine. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality determined via UK Office of National Statistics. A total of 562 (12.0\%) of patients developed AKI after CABG surgery. Patients who developed AKI were older, more likely to be female, and had more comorbidity than patients who did not develop AKI. In a Cox multivariable analysis, the development of AKI was an independent predictor of midterm mortality (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95\% confidence interval, 1.50-2.16). Subsequently, a comparison of 562 patients who sustained AKI with 562 propensity score-matched patients who did not sustain AKI was undertaken. After propensity matching, baseline clinical and operative characteristics were similar between both groups. After Cox multivariable analysis of the propensity-matched cohort, AKI remained an independent predictor of midterm mortality (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95\% confidence interval, 1.19-1.93). CONCLUSIONS: The development of AKI after CABG is a serious event associated with worse midterm survival. This excess mortality cannot be explained simply by coexisting comorbidity and surgical complexity.},

Here, we present a single-molecule molecular inversion probe and sequencing-based MSI assay and demonstrate its clinical validity according to existing guidelines. We amplified 24 microsatellites in multiplex and trained a classifier using 98 CRCs, which accommodates marker specific sensitivities to MSI. Sample classification achieved 100\% concordance with the MSI Analysis System v1.2 (Promega) in three independent cohorts, totaling 220 CRCs. Backward–forward stepwise selection was used to identify a 6-marker subset of equal accuracy to the 24-marker panel. Assessment of assay detection limits showed that the 24-marker panel is marginally more robust to sample variables than the 6-marker subset, detecting as little as 3\% high levels of MSI DNA in sample mixtures, and requiring a minimum of 10 template molecules to be sequenced per marker for ¿95\% accuracy. BRAF c.1799 mutation analysis was also included to streamline LS testing, with all c.1799T¿A variants being correctly identified. The assay, therefore, provides a cheap, robust, automatable, and scalable MSI test with internal quality controls, suitable for clinical cancer diagnostics.},

Correct AF individuation bears strong relevance in primary and secondary stroke prevention. Our goal was to evaluate the reliability of a low-cost, non-invasive technology in detecting AF in acute stroke patients. AFib model BP3MQ1-2D (Microlife USA, Dunedin, FL) showed good accuracy in diagnosing AF in a general cardiologic outpatient population. We carried out an observational study in patients with recent stroke. We studied 207 subjects, 103 men, 104 women, mean age (±SD) 77.7 ± 11.34 years, who underwent a test by AFib device with indication of AF or lack of it. The golden standard was a 12-lead EKG done immediately and evaluated by a certified cardiologist. We computed estimates of Sensitivity and Specificity and their 95 \% confidence intervals (CI). AF was present in 38 subjects from the sample of 207 (18.4 \%). AFib correctly demonstrated AF in 34 and failed diagnosing AF in 4 cases; on the other hand, AFib correctly excluded AF in 167 and caused an erroneous diagnosis of AF in 2 cases. The Sensitivity was 0.895 (95 \% CI 0.7597–0.958) and the Specificity was 0.988 (95 \% CI 0.958–0.997). The AFib device global accuracy was 0.971 (95 \% CI 0.938–0.987). This device was able to detect AF with high specificity and a good sensitivity. This device may be considered as an accurate tool in detecting AF in stroke patients.},

They include longstanding systems such as the International Classification of Diseases and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as well as more recent systems such as the Read Clinical Classification and Snomed, though coded vocabularies themselves are only the visible tip of the standards iceberg. Work on clinical information standards is not glamorous, but such standards are fundamental for progress in health care. They are essential resources for future clinical decision support, audit, governance, research, education, and training. In a very real sense, these standards define what can be said about patient care. In this issue Brown et al describe a crossover trial comparing the accuracy and usability of two clinical terminology standards in a setting designed to reflect tasks and circumstances commonly encountered in contemporary British general practice (p 1127).1 The paper may seem of limited relevance, in that it is focused on Britain, on primary care, and on two specific clinical standards, both of which are probably obsolescent.

  abstract = {Background. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is widely used in high risk patients (pts) with aortic stenosis. Underlying chronic kidney disease implicates a high risk of postprocedural acute kidney injury (AKI). We analyzed its occurrence, impact on hospital stay, and mortality. Methods. 150 consecutive pts underwent TAVI in our institution (mean age 81 ± 7 years; logistic EuroSCORE 24 ± 15\%). AKI definition was a creatinine rise of 26.5 μmol/L or more within 48 hours postprocedural. Ten patients on chronic hemodialysis were excluded. Results. AKI occurred in 28 pts (20\%). Baseline creatinine was higher in AKI pts (126.4 ± 59.2 μmol/L versus 108.7 ± 45.1 μmol/L, P = 0.09). Contrast media use was distributed evenly. Both, 30-day mortality (29\% versus 7\%, P \textbackslash textless 0.0001) and long-term mortality (43\% versus 18\%, P \textbackslash textless 0.0001) were higher; hospital stay was longer in AKI pts (20 ± 12 versus 15 ± 10 days, P = 0.03). Predicted renal failure calculated STS Score was similar (8.0 ± 5.0\% [AKI] versus 7.1 ± 4.0\% [non-AKI], P = 0.32) and estimated lower renal failure rates than observed. Conclusion. AKI remains a frequent complication with increased mortality in TAVI pts. Careful identification of risk factors and development of more suitable risk scores are essential.},

  abstract = {Summary When testing for a rare disease, prevalence estimates can be highly sensitive to uncertainty in the specificity and sensitivity of the test. Bayesian inference is a natural way to propagate these uncertainties, with hierarchical modelling capturing variation in these parameters across experiments. Another concern is the people in the sample not being representative of the general population. Statistical adjustment cannot without strong assumptions correct for selection bias in an opt-in sample, but multilevel regression and post-stratification can at least adjust for known differences between the sample and the population. We demonstrate hierarchical regression and post-stratification models with code in Stan and discuss their application to a controversial recent study of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a sample of people from the Stanford University area. Wide posterior intervals make it impossible to evaluate the quantitative claims of that study regarding the number of unreported infections. For future studies, the methods described here should facilitate more accurate estimates of disease prevalence from imperfect tests performed on non-representative samples.},

However, this problem may be sidestepped by focusing on the clinical consequences of the decision rather than on estimation of accuracy. Consequences can be assessed by use of a "fair umpire" test that is not perfect yet can discriminate between disease and nondisease cases and is not biased in favor of 1 test. This article discusses 3 principles to aid judgments about the value of new tests. First, the consequences are best examined in cases with disagreement between the current and new tests. Second, resolving these disagreements requires a fair, but not necessarily perfect, umpire test. Finally, umpire tests include consequences, such as prognosis and response to treatment, as well as causal exposures and other test results.},

  abstract = {Objectives To compare the expected costs and outcomes of seven alternative long-term primary care strategies for the management of patients with moderate-to-severe heartburn over a 1-year period. Methods A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate costs and effects (weeks with heartburn symptoms and quality adjusted life years QALYs]) for each strategy. Meta-analyses were used to synthesize acute treatment and maintenance studies and physician surveys to collect information on patient management. The impact of uncertainty on the base case results was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Probability distributions were defined for key model parameters and techniques of Monte Carlo simulation were used to draw values from these distributions. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) conditional on the monetary value decision makers are willing to pay for a symptom-free day or QALY were created for each strategy. Results In the base case, no strategy was strictly dominated by any other strategy. However, two strategies (maintenance H2-receptor antagonists H2RA] and step-down proton pump inhibitor PPI]) were dominated through principles of extended dominance. The least costly and least effective strategy was intermittent H2RA, while maintenance PPI was the most costly and most effective. Conclusions This analysis showed that the best way of managing patients with heartburn depends on how much society is willing to pay to achieve health improvements. Based on the commonly quoted threshold of \$50,000 per QALY, the optimal primary care strategy for managing patients with moderate-to-severe heartburn symptoms is to treat the symptoms with a PPI followed by maintenance therapy with an H2RA to prevent symptomatic recurrence.},

Despite a substantial history of eye movement data collection in tasks, there is still a great need for an organized definition and evaluation of appropriate measures. Several measures based upon eye movement locations and scanpaths were evaluated here, to assess their validity for assessment of interface quality. Good and poor interfaces for a drawing tool selection program were developed by manipulating the grouping of tool icons. These were subsequently evaluated by a collection of 50 interface designers and typical users. Twelve subjects used the interfaces while their eye movements were collected. Compared with a randomly organized set of component buttons, well-organized functional grouping resulted in shorter scanpaths, covering smaller areas. The poorer interface resuilted in more, but similar duration, fixations than the better interface. Whereas the poor interface produced less efficient search behavior, the layout of componenet representations did not influence their interpretability. Overall, data obtained from eye movements can significantly enhance the observation of users' strategies while using computer interfaces, which can subsequently improve the precision of computer interface evaluations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Service reorganization to concentrate complex vascular services in hospitals with high caseload volume aims to reduce mortality and complication rates. The present study assessed the relationship between caseload volume and outcome for iliac artery angioplasty and stenting in England using a routinely available national data set (Hospital Episode Statistics, HES). METHODS: Routine administrative data for iliac artery angioplasty and stent procedures performed in England between 2007 and 2011 were analysed. Associations between centre volume and outcomes (death, complications and duration of hospital stay) were tested and compared for two methods of stratification (quartiles and quintiles) and two statistical tests (odds ratios and the Cochran-Armitage test for trend). Multivariable analysis was also performed. RESULTS: There were 23 308 episodes of care recorded in HES with Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures, fourth revision, codes L54.1 or L54.4 corresponding to iliac artery intervention. There was a gradual increase year by year in number of procedures performed. Univariable and multivariable analysis showed no association between centre volume and either death or complications (multivariable odds ratio, OR 1·00, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·00 to 1·00) for elective and non-elective procedures. Age was associated with higher mortality and complication rates in elective procedures, and with mortality in non-elective procedures. The risk of death after elective iliac angioplasty or stenting was significantly higher in women (multivariable OR 4·98, 2·09 to 13·26). CONCLUSION: There was no association between the outcomes of endovascular iliac artery intervention and centre volume, but outcomes were significantly worse with increasing age and female sex.},

  abstract = {Objective An overabundance of bacteria in the chronic wound plays a significant role in the decreased ability for primary closure. One means of decreasing the bioburden in a wound is to operatively debride the wound for wound bed optimization prior to application of other therapy, such as Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT). We undertook a prospective pilot study to assess the efficacy of wound bed preparation for a standard algorithm (sharp surgical debridement followed by NPWT) versus one employing sharp surgical debridement followed by Negative Pressure Wound Therapy with Instillation (NPWTi). Methods Thirteen patients, corresponding to 16 chronic lower leg and foot wounds were taken to the operating room for debridement. The patients were sequentially enrolled in 2 treatment groups: the first receiving treatment with operative debridement followed by 1 week of NPWT with the instillation of quarter strength bleach solution; the other receiving a standard algorithm consisting of operative debridement and 1 week of NPWT. Quantitative cultures were taken pre-operatively after sterile preparation and draping of the wound site (POD \# 0, pre-op), post-operatively once debridement was completed (POD \# 0, post-op), and on post-operative day 7 after operative debridement (POD \# 7, post-op). Results After operative debridement (post-operative day 0) there was a mean of 3 (±1) types of bacteria per wound. The mean CFU/gram tissue culture was statistically greater – 3.7~×~106 (±4~×~106) in the NPWTi group, while in the standard group (NPWT) the mean was 1.8~×~106 (±2.36~×~106) CFU/gram tissue culture (p~=~0.016); at the end of therapy there was no statistical difference between the two groups (p~=~0.44). Wounds treated with NPWTi had a mean of 2.6~×~105 (±3~×~105) CFU/gram of tissue culture while wounds treated with NPWT had a mean of 2.79~×~106 (±3.18~×~106) CFU/gram of tissue culture (p~=~0.43). The mean absolute reduction in bacteria for the NPWTi group was 10.6~×~106 bacteria per gram of tissue while there was a mean absolute increase in bacteria for the NPWT group of 28.7~×~106 bacteria per gram of tissue, therefore there was a statistically significant reduction in the absolute bioburden in those wounds treated with NPWTi (p~=~0.016). Conclusion It has long been realized that NPWT does not make its greatest impact by bioburden reduction. Other work has demonstrated that debridement alone does not reduce wound bioburden by more than 1 Log. Wounds treated with NPWTi (in this case with quarter strength bleach instillation solution) had a statistically significant reduction in bioburden, while wounds treated with NPWT had an increase in bioburden over the 7 days.},

Accurate blood pressure measurement is central to high-quality hypertension management. In this study of 106 patients, the BpTRUTM device was compared to nurse blood pressure measurements that complied with all the JNC VII/American Heart Association guidelines in evaluation of a random casual blood pressure. The intermethod difference in systolic blood pressure was +1.8±5.1 mmHg, and for diastolic blood pressure it was 4.8±5.1 mmHg (both P{$<$}0.001). For the primary study end point of clinical decision-making, there was 92\% (97/106) agreement between the hypertension nurse specialist and the BpTRU™ (kappa 0.8280, 95\% confidence interval, 0.721–0.9350). The oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the BpTRU™ is recommended as a replacement for poorly performed auscultatory blood pressure measurement in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To create a valid, sensitive, disease-specific health status measure for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). BACKGROUND Quantifying health status is becoming increasingly important for CHF. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a new, self-administered, 23-item questionnaire that quantifies physical limitations, symptoms, self-efficacy, social interference and quality of life. METHODS To establish the performance characteristics of the KCCQ, two distinct patient cohorts were recruited: 70 stable and 59 decompensated CHF patients with ejection fractions of {$<$}40. Upon entry into the study, patients were administered the KCCQ, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire and the Short Form-36 (SF-36). Questionnaires were repeated three months later. RESULTS Convergent validity of each KCCQ domain was documented by comparison with available criterion standards (r = 0.46 to 0.74; p {$<$} 0.001 for all). Among those with stable CHF who remained stable by predefined criteria (n = 39), minimal changes in KCCQ domains were detected over three months of observation (mean change = 0.8 to 4.0 points, p = NS for all). In contrast, large changes in score were observed among patients whose decompensated CHF improved three months later (n = 39; mean change = 15.4 to 40.4 points, p {$<$} 0.01 for all). The sensitivity of the KCCQ was substantially greater than that of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure and the SF-36 questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS The KCCQ is a valid, reliable and responsive health status measure for patients with CHF and may serve as a clinically meaningful outcome in cardiovascular research, patient management and quality assessment.},

We conducted a methodology review of reports where probability distributions had been elicited from experts to be used in model-based health technology assessments.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS: Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the CRD database were searched from inception to April 2013. Reference lists were checked and citation mapping was also used. Studies describing their approach to the elicitation of probability distributions were included. Data was abstracted on pre-defined aspects of the elicitation technique. Reports were critically appraised on their consideration of the validity, reliability and feasibility of the elicitation exercise.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: Fourteen articles were included. Across these studies, the most marked features were heterogeneity in elicitation approach and failure to report key aspects of the elicitation method. The most frequently used approaches to elicitation were the histogram technique and the bisection method. Only three papers explicitly considered the validity, reliability and feasibility of the elicitation exercises.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSION: Judged by the studies identified in the review, reports of expert elicitation are insufficient in detail and this impacts on the perceived usability of expert-elicited probability distributions. In this context, the wider credibility of elicitation will only be improved by better reporting and greater standardisation of approach. Until then, the advantage of eliciting probability distributions from experts may be lost.},

Nevertheless, the underlying dynamics of the ChR2-evoked spikes are still not yet fully understood. Here, we develop a model that describes the response of ChR2-expressing neurons to light stimuli and use the model to explore the light-to-spike process. We show that an optimal stimulation yield is achieved when the optical energies are delivered in short pulses. The model allows us to theoretically examine the effects of using various types of ChR2 mutants. We show that while increasing the lifetime and shuttering speed of ChR2 have limited effect, reducing the threshold irradiance by increased conductance will eliminate adaptation and allow constant dynamic range. The model and the conclusion presented in this study can help to interpret experimental results, design illumination protocols, and seek improvement strategies in the nascent optogenetic field.},

  abstract = {Objectives Our aim was to estimate the rate of data linkage error in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) by testing the HESID pseudoanonymisation algorithm against a reference standard, in a national registry of paediatric intensive care records.Setting The Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) database, covering 33 paediatric intensive care units in England, Scotland and Wales.Participants Data from infants and young people aged 0–19\hspace{0.25em}years admitted between 1 January 2004 and 21 February 2014.Primary and secondary outcome measures PICANet admission records were classified as matches (records belonging to the same patient who had been readmitted) or non-matches (records belonging to different patients) after applying the HESID algorithm to PICANet records. False-match and missed-match rates were calculated by comparing results of the HESID algorithm with the reference standard PICANet ID. The effect of linkage errors on readmission rate was evaluated.Results Of 166\hspace{0.25em}406 admissions, 88\hspace{0.25em}596 were true matches (where the same patient had been readmitted). The HESID pseudonymisation algorithm produced few false matches (n=176/77\hspace{0.25em}810; 0.2\%) but a larger proportion of missed matches (n=3609/88\hspace{0.25em}596; 4.1\%). The true readmission rate was underestimated by 3.8\% due to linkage errors. Patients who were younger, male, from Asian/Black/Other ethnic groups (vs White) were more likely to experience a false match. Missed matches were more common for younger patients, for Asian/Black/Other ethnic groups (vs White) and for patients whose records had missing data.Conclusions The deterministic algorithm used to link all episodes of hospital care for the same patient in England has a high missed match rate which underestimates the true readmission rate and will produce biased analyses. To reduce linkage error, pseudoanonymisation algorithms need to be validated against good quality reference standards. Pseudonymisation of data ‘at source’ does not itself address errors in patient identifiers and the impact these errors have on data linkage.},

We compared the existing deterministic algorithm with one that included an additional probabilistic step, in relation to a reference standard created using enhanced probabilistic matching with additional clinical and demographic information. Missed and false matches were quantified and the impact on estimates of hospital readmission within one year was determined.Results HESID produced a high missed match rate, improving over time (8.6\% in 1998 to 0.4\% in 2015). Missed matches were more common for ethnic minorities, those living in areas of high socio-economic deprivation, foreign patients and those with ‘no fixed abode’. Estimates of the readmission rate were biased for several patient groups owing to missed matches, which were reduced for nearly all groups.Conclusion Probabilistic linkage of HES reduced missed matches and bias in estimated readmission rates, with clear implications for commissioning, service evaluation and performance monitoring of hospitals. The existing algorithm should be modified to address data linkage error, and a retrospective update of the existing data would address existing linkage errors and their implications.},

The results have been analysed in terms of age, stature, mass, body fat, and smoking. In addition to their relation to stature and to age, the inspiratory capacity was positively correlated with indices of body muscle while the residual volume, expiratory reserve volume, and total lung capacity were inversely correlated with the percentage of body mass that is fat or with mass divided by the square of stature. The inverse correlation between total lung capacity and age was apparently due to the quantity of body fat increasing with age. The transfer factor and its subdivisions were inversely correlated with smoking. In this study the forced expiratory volume and vital capacity were independent of both fat and smoking; the transfer factor was independent of the physiological response to exercise.

  abstract = {Abstract Automation in histopathology is an attractive concept and recent advances in the application of computerized expert systems and machine vision have made automated image analysis of histological images possible. Systems capable of complete automation not only require the ability to segment tissue features and grade histological abnormalities, but must also be capable of locating diagnostically useful areas from within complex histological scenes. This is the first stage of the diagnostic process. The object of this study was to develop criteria for the automatic identification of focal areas of colorectal dysplasia from a background of histologically normal tissue. Fields of view representing normal colorectal mucosa (n=120) and dysplastic mucosa (n=120) were digitally captured and subjected to image texture analysis. Two features were selected as being the most important in the discrimination of normal and adenomatous colorectal mucosa. The first was a feature of the co-occurrence matrix and the second was the number of low optical density pixels in the image. A linear classification rule defined using these two features was capable of correctly classifying 86 per cent of a series of training images into their correct groups. In addition, large histological scenes were digitally captured, split into their component images, analysed according to texture, and classified as normal or abnormal using the previously defined classification rule. Maps of the histological scenes were constructed and in most cases, dysplastic colorectal mucosa was correctly identified on the basis of image texture: 83 per cent of test images were correctly classified. This study demonstrates that abnormalities in low-power tissue morphology can be identified using quantitative image analysis. The identification of diagnostically useful fields advances the potential of automated systems in histopathology: these regions could than be scrutinized at high power using knowledge-guided image segmentation for disease grading. Systems of this kind have the potential to provide objectivity, unbiased sampling, and valuable diagnostic decision support. ? 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Objectives To estimate the risk of developing cancer in relation to the typical radiation doses received from a range of X-ray guided cardiac catheterisations in children, taking variable survival into account.Methods Radiation doses were estimated for 2749 procedures undertaken at five UK hospitals using Monte Carlo simulations. The lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer incidence was estimated using models developed by the Biological Effects of Ionising Radiation committee, based on both normal life expectancy, and as a function of attained age, from 20 to 80 years, to take reduced life expectancy into account.Results The radiation-related risks from these procedures are dominated by lung and breast cancer (for females). Assuming normal life expectancy, central LAR estimates for cancer incidence, based on median doses, ranged from \textbackslash textless1 in 2000 for atrial septal defect occlusions to as high as 1 in 150 for valve replacements. For a reduced life expectancy of 50 years, estimated risks are lower by a factor of around 7. For conditions with especially poor survival (age 20 years), such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, estimated cancer risks attributable to radiation were \textbackslash textless1 in 20 000.Conclusions Based on recent UK radiation dose levels, the risk of cancer following cardiac catheterisations is relatively low and strongly modified by survival and the type of procedure. The risk of breast cancer, especially following pulmonary artery angioplasty and valve replacements, is the greatest concern.},

  abstract = {Objective:To identify current UK screening practices prior to contrast-enhanced CT. To determine the patient management strategies to minimize the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) risk in outpatients.Methods:An invitation to complete an electronic survey was distributed to the CT managers of 174 UK adult National Health Service hospital trusts. The survey included questions related to local protocols and national guidance on which these are based. Details of the assessment of renal function prior to imaging and thresholds for contrast contraindication and patient management were also sought.Results:A response rate of 47.1\% was received. Almost all sites had a policy in place for contrast administration (n?=?80/82; 97.6\%). The majority of sites require a blood test on outpatients undergoing a contrast-enhanced CT scan (n?=?75/82; 91.5\%); however, some (15/75; 20.0\%) sites only check the result in patients at high risk and a small number (7/82; 8.5\%) of sites indicated that it was a referrer responsibility. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or serum creatinine (SCr) result threshold at which i.v. contrast was contraindicated varied and 19 different threshold levels of eGFR or SCr were identified, each leading to different prophylactic strategies. Inconsistency was noted in the provision of follow-up blood tests after contrast administration.Conclusion:The wide variation in practice reflects inconsistencies in published guidance. Evidence-based consensuses of which patients to test and subsequent risk thresholds will aid clinicians identify those patients in which the risk of CI-AKI is clinically significant but manageable. There is also a need to determine the value of the various prophylactic strategies, follow-up regimen and efficient service delivery pathways.Advances in knowledge:This survey has identified that further work is required to define which patients are high risk, confirm those which require renal function testing prior to contrast administration and how best to manage patients at risk of CI-AKI. The role of new technologies within this service delivery pathway requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {Linkage of population-based administrative data is a valuable tool for combining detailed individual-level information from different sources for research. While not a substitute for classical studies based on primary data collection, analyses of linked administrative data can answer questions that require large sample sizes or detailed data on hard-to-reach populations, and generate evidence with a high level of external validity and applicability for policy making. There are unique challenges in the appropriate research use of linked administrative data, for example with respect to bias from linkage errors where records cannot be linked or are linked together incorrectly. For confidentiality and other reasons, the separation of data linkage processes and analysis of linked data is generally regarded as best practice. However, the ?black box? of data linkage can make it difficult for researchers to judge the reliability of the resulting linked data for their required purposes. This article aims to provide an overview of challenges in linking administrative data for research. We aim to increase understanding of the implications of (i) the data linkage environment and privacy preservation; (ii) the linkage process itself (including data preparation, and deterministic and probabilistic linkage methods) and (iii) linkage quality and potential bias in linked data. We draw on examples from a number of countries to illustrate a range of approaches for data linkage in different contexts.},

  abstract = {Linked datasets are an important resource for epidemiological and clinical studies, but linkage error can lead to biased results. For data security reasons, linkage of personal identifiers is often performed by a third party, making it difficult for researchers to assess the quality of the linked dataset in the context of specific research questions. This is compounded by a lack of guidance on how to determine the potential impact of linkage error. We describe how linkage quality can be evaluated and provide widely applicable guidance for both data providers and researchers. Using an illustrative example of a linked dataset of maternal and baby hospital records, we demonstrate three approaches for evaluating linkage quality: applying the linkage algorithm to a subset of gold standard data to quantify linkage error; comparing characteristics of linked and unlinked data to identify potential sources of bias; and evaluating the sensitivity of results to changes in the linkage procedure. These approaches can inform our understanding of the potential impact of linkage error and provide an opportunity to select the most appropriate linkage procedure for a specific analysis. Evaluating linkage quality in this way will improve the quality and transparency of epidemiological and clinical research using linked data.},

  abstract = {Background Quality of life is increasingly used as an important end point in clinical trials of treatments for heart failure; thus, relationships between traditional clinical variables and quality of life need to be understood. Baseline data from an ongoing multi-institutional study of a surgically implanted cardiac support device (CorCap, Acorn Cardiovascular, Inc, St Paul, MN) positioned around the heart to halt progression of remodeling in patients with cardiomyopathy provide an opportunity to study the relationship between mitral regurgitation (MR) and quality of life in a group of relatively young patients. Objective The objective of this study was to determine whether the degree of MR correlates with quality of life in patients presenting with significant symptoms of heart failure. Methods Baseline MR was assessed by echocardiography and patients were stratified according to whether there was a clinical indication for mitral valve surgery. The effect of heart failure on quality of life was measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHF). The New York Heart Association class, exercise performance measured by peak oxygen consumption and the 6-minute walk test, and the SF-36 physical function measure were analyzed as potential mediating variables. Results Mean MR grade was 2 ± 1.5 on a 0-to-4 (worst) scale (n = 260) and ejection fraction averaged 27\% ± 9\%. Most patients (82\%) had New York Heart Association class III symptoms. Peak oxygen consumption averaged 14.7 ± 4.3 mL/kg per minute and average walking distance was 348 ± 83 m. Median (quartile range) SF-36 physical function was 35 (20-50) on a 0-to-100 (best) scale. Median MLHF score was 61 (47.5-77) on a 0-to-105 (worst) scale. The degree of MR and having an indication for mitral valve repair were not associated with the patients' quality of life. Controlling for symptoms and functional measures, older age was independently associated with better quality of life. Conclusions The degree of MR was not related to MLHF scores, suggesting that surgery to reduce MR might not have predictable effects on quality of life. Further studies are needed to understand why younger patients reported worse quality of life and how this observation could impact therapy.},

We aimed to derive age and sex related ambulatory blood pressure equivalents to clinic blood pressure thresholds for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.Methods We collated 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure data, recorded with validated devices, from 11 centres across six Australian states (n=8575). We used least product regression to assess the relation between these measurements and clinic blood pressure measured by trained staff and in a smaller cohort by doctors (n=1693).Results Mean age of participants was 56 years (SD 15) with mean body mass index 28.9 (5.5) and mean clinic systolic/diastolic blood pressure 142/82 mm Hg (19/12); 4626 (54\%) were women. Average clinic measurements by trained staff were 6/3 mm Hg higher than daytime ambulatory blood pressure and 10/5 mm Hg higher than 24 hour blood pressure, but 9/7 mm Hg lower than clinic values measured by doctors. Daytime ambulatory equivalents derived from trained staff clinic measurements were 4/3 mm Hg less than the 140/90 mm Hg clinic threshold (lower limit of grade 1 hypertension), 2/2 mm Hg less than the 130/80 mm Hg threshold (target upper limit for patients with associated conditions), and 1/1 mm Hg less than the 125/75 mm Hg threshold. Equivalents were 1/2 mm Hg lower for women and 3/1 mm Hg lower in older people compared with the combined group.Conclusions Our study provides daytime ambulatory blood pressure thresholds that are slightly lower than equivalent clinic values. Clinic blood pressure measurements taken by doctors were considerably higher than those taken by trained staff and therefore gave inappropriate estimates of ambulatory thresholds. These results provide a framework for the diagnosis and management of hypertension using ambulatory blood pressure values.}

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Difficult Asthma Network has established an online National Registry to standardise specialist UK difficult asthma services and to facilitate research into the assessment and clinical management of difficult asthma.Methods Data from 382 well characterised patients, who fulfilled the American Thoracic Society definition for refractory asthma attending four specialist UK centres—Royal Brompton Hospital, London, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, University Hospital of South Manchester and Belfast City Hospital—were used to compare patient demographics, disease characteristics and healthcare utilisation.Results Many demographic variables including gender, ethnicity and smoking prevalence were similar in UK centres and consistent with other published cohorts of refractory asthma. However, multiple demographic factors such as employment, family history, atopy prevalence, lung function, rates of hospital admission/unscheduled healthcare visits and medication usage were different from published data and significantly different between UK centres. General linear modelling with unscheduled healthcare visits, rescue oral steroids and hospital admissions as dependent variables all identified a significant association with clinical centre; different associations were identified when centre was not included as a factor.Conclusion Whilst there are similarities in UK patients with refractory asthma consistent with other comparable published cohorts, there are also differences, which may reflect different patient populations. These differences in important population characteristics were also identified within different UK specialist centres. Pooling multicentre data on subjects with refractory asthma may miss important differences and potentially confound attempts to phenotype this population.},

  abstract = {Carl Heneghan and colleagues describe how failings in the process for the marketing approval of implantable transvaginal mesh devices may have exposed women to avoidable harms and how to avoid their repetition Concern is increasing that use of transvaginal mesh devices to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse has exposed women to avoidable harms. Part of the problem may lie with the governance of medical devices, which has enabled new devices to be brought to market with inadequate evidence, and over 100 000 litigation cases are now under way.1 We consider how improvements to both regulatory approvals and the structures supporting evidence based practice among clinicians could help prevent similar problems in the future. Mesh has been used to treat stress urinary incontinence and prolapse for the past 20 years because it overcomes the need to harvest native tissue, is less invasive, takes less surgical time, and has been thought to reduce the risk of recurrent prolapse. Transvaginal mesh made from polypropylene is used to treat stress urinary incontinence. This operation involves creating a bladder sling using a strip of mesh (referred to as tape) that is inserted through vaginal and abdominal incisions. Similar techniques are used to treat pelvic organ prolapse, with vaginal mesh made from the same material used to support the tissues which hold the vaginal walls and uterus in place. Although the evidence for use of bladder slings is to some extent reassuring,2 that for vaginal prolapse mesh has been controversial.3 The many different brands of mesh devices currently available are predominantly polypropylene based. However, they differ in pore size (macroporous or microporous) and fibre configuration (braided, woven, or monofilament); fibres can include a non-absorbable coat with a thin layer of porous collagen, and surface area can vary.4 Polypropylene mesh \textbackslash ldots},

PAD was considered present if the ABI was 0.90 or less, if it was documented in the medical record, or if there was a history of limb revascularization. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined as a history of atherosclerotic coronary, cerebral, or abdominal aortic aneurysmal disease.Main Outcome MeasuresFrequency of detection of PAD; physician and patient awareness of PAD diagnosis; treatment intensity in PAD patients compared with treatment of other forms of CVD and with patients without clinical evidence of atherosclerosis.ResultsPAD was detected in 1865 patients (29\%); 825 of these (44\%) had PAD only, without evidence of CVD. Overall, 13\% had PAD only, 16\% had PAD and CVD, 24\% had CVD only, and 47\% had neither PAD nor CVD (the reference group). There were 457 patients (55\%) with newly diagnosed PAD only and 366 (35\%) with PAD and CVD who were newly diagnosed during the survey. Eighty-three percent of patients with prior PAD were aware of their diagnosis, but only 49\% of physicians were aware of this diagnosis. Among patients with PAD, classic claudication was distinctly uncommon (11\%). Patients with PAD had similar atherosclerosis risk factor profiles compared with those who had CVD. Smoking behavior was more frequently treated in patients with new (53\%) and prior PAD (51\%) only than in those with CVD only (35\%; P \&lt;.001). Hypertension was treated less frequently in new (84\%) and prior PAD (88\%) only vs CVD only (95\%; P \&lt;.001) and hyperlipidemia was treated less frequently in new (44\%) and prior PAD (56\%) only vs CVD only (73\%, P\&lt;.001). Antiplatelet medications were prescribed less often in patients with new (33\%) and prior PAD (54\%) only vs CVD only (71\%, P\&lt;.001). Treatment intensity for diabetes and use of hormone replacement therapy in women were similar across all groups.ConclusionsPrevalence of PAD in primary care practices is high, yet physician awareness of the PAD diagnosis is relatively low. A simple ABI measurement identified a large number of patients with previously unrecognized PAD. Atherosclerosis risk factors were very prevalent in PAD patients, but these patients received less intensive treatment for lipid disorders and hypertension and were prescribed antiplatelet therapy less frequently than were patients with CVD. These results demonstrate that underdiagnosis of PAD in primary care practice may be a barrier to effective secondary prevention of the high ischemic cardiovascular risk associated with PAD.},

Also to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of different methods of recording and interpreting the electrocardiogram (ECG) within a screening programme. DESIGN Multicentred randomised controlled trial. Purposefully selected general practices were randomly allocated to 25 intervention practices and 25 control practices. SETTING Fifty primary care centres across the West Midlands, UK. PARTICIPANTS Patients aged 65 years and over. INTERVENTIONS GPs and practice nurses in the intervention practices received education on the importance of AF detection and ECG interpretation. Patients in the intervention practices were randomly allocated to systematic (n = 5000) or opportunistic screening (n = 5000). Prospective identification of pre-existing risk factors for AF within the screened population enabled comparison between targeted screening of people at higher risk of AF and total population screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AF detection rates in systematically screened and opportunistically screened populations in the intervention practices were compared with AF detection rate in 5000 patients in the control practices. The screening period was 12 months. RESULTS Baseline prevalence of AF was 7.2\%, with a higher prevalence in males (7.8\%) and patients aged 75 years and over (10.3\%). The control population demonstrated higher baseline prevalence (7.9\%) than either the systematic (6.9\%) or opportunistic (6.9\%) intervention population. In the control population 47 new cases were detected (incidence 1.04\% per year). In the opportunistic arm 243 patients without a baseline diagnosis of AF were found to have an irregular pulse, with 177 having an ECG, yielding 31 new cases (incidence 0.69\% per year). A further 44 cases were detected outside the screening programme (overall incidence 1.64\% per year). In the systematic arm 2357 patients had an ECG yielding 52 new cases (incidence 1.1\% per year). Of these, 31 were detected by targeted screening and a further 21 by total population screening. A further 22 cases were detected outside the screening programme (overall incidence 1.62\% per year). In terms of ECG interpretation, computerised decision support software (CDSS) gave a sensitivity of 87.3\%, a specificity of 99.1\% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89.5\% compared with the gold standard (cardiologist reporting). GPs and practice nurses performed less well. The only difference in performance between intervention populations and controls was that practice nurses from the control arm performed less well than with intervention practice nurses on interpretation of limb-lead (PPV 38.8\% versus 20.8\%) and single-lead (PPV 37.7\% versus 24.0\%) ECGs. The within-trial economic evaluation results showed the lowest incremental cost to be for the opportunistic arm, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 337 pounds Sterling for each additional case detected compared to the control arm. Opportunistic screening dominated both more intensive screening strategies. Model-based analyses showed small differences in cost and quality-adjusted life-years for different methods and intensities of screening, but annual opportunistic screening resulted in the lowest number of ischaemic strokes and greatest proportion of cases of AF diagnosed. Probabilistic sensitivity results indicated that there was a probability of approximately 60\% that screening from the age of 65 years was cost-effective in both men and women. CONCLUSIONS The results of the study indicated that in terms of a screening programme for atrial fibrillation in patients 65 and over, the only strategy that improved on routine practice was opportunistic screening, model-based analyses indicated that there was a probability of approximately 60\% of annual opportunistic screening being cost effective. It is suggested that the following topics are worthy of further investigation: the effect of the implementation of a screening programme for AF on the uptake and maintenance of anticoagulation in patients aged 65 years and over; an evaluation of the role of CDSS in the diagnosis of cardiac arrythmias; the best method for routinely detecting paroxysmal AF; ways of improving healthcare professionals' performance in ECG interpretation; development of a robust economic model to incorporate data on new therapeutic agents for use as thromboprophylactic agents for patients with AF, and an evaluation of the relative risk of stroke for patients with incident as opposed to prevalent AF.},

Methodological quality was appraised, including evidence of validation of blood pressure measurement equipment.Data sources Medline (from 1966), Embase (from 1980), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, Medion, ARIF, and TRIP up to May 2010.Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Eligible studies examined diagnosis of hypertension in adults of all ages using home and/or clinic blood pressure measurement compared with those made using ambulatory monitoring that clearly defined thresholds to diagnose hypertension.Results The 20 eligible studies used various thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension, and only seven studies (clinic) and three studies (home) could be directly compared with ambulatory monitoring. Compared with ambulatory monitoring thresholds of 135/85 mm Hg, clinic measurements over 140/90 mm Hg had mean sensitivity and specificity of 74.6\% (95\% confidence interval 60.7\% to 84.8\%) and 74.6\% (47.9\% to 90.4\%), respectively, whereas home measurements over 135/85 mm Hg had mean sensitivity and specificity of 85.7\% (78.0\% to 91.0\%) and 62.4\% (48.0\% to 75.0\%).Conclusions Neither clinic nor home measurement had sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be recommended as a single diagnostic test. If ambulatory monitoring is taken as the reference standard, then treatment decisions based on clinic or home blood pressure alone might result in substantial overdiagnosis. Ambulatory monitoring before the start of lifelong drug treatment might lead to more appropriate targeting of treatment, particularly around the diagnostic threshold.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The quality of care delivered and clinical outcomes of care are of paramount importance. Wide variations in the outcome of emergency care have been suggested, but the scale of variation, and the way in which outcomes are inter-related are poorly defined and are critical to understand how best to improve services. This study quantifies the scale of variation in three outcomes for a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing emergency medical and surgical admissions. The way in which the outcomes of different diagnoses relate to each other is investigated. METHODS: A retrospective study using the English Hospital Episode Statistics 2005-2010 with one-year follow-up for all patients with one of 20 of the commonest and highest-risk emergency medical or surgical conditions. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause risk-standardised mortality rate (in-RSMR). Secondary outcomes were 1-year all-cause risk-standardised mortality rate (1 yr-RSMR) and 28-day all-cause emergency readmission rate (RSRR). RESULTS: 2,406,709 adult patients underwent emergency medical or surgical admissions in the groups of interest. Clinically and statistically significant variations in outcome were observed between providers for all three outcomes (p \textbackslash textless 0.001). For some diagnoses including heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke and fractured neck of femur, more than 20\% of hospitals lay above the upper 95\% control limit and were statistical outliers. The risk-standardised outcomes within a given hospital for an individual diagnostic group were significantly associated with the aggregated outcome of the other clinical groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-level risk-standardised outcomes for emergency admissions across a range of specialties vary considerably and cross traditional speciality boundaries. This suggests that global institutional infra-structure and processes of care influence outcomes. The implications are far reaching, both in terms of investigating performance at individual hospitals and in understanding how hospitals can learn from the best performers to improve outcomes.},

Consequently, there is a global demand for continuous and non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurements that are convenient, easy to use, and more accurate than the currently available methods for detecting hypertension. This could easily be achieved through the integration of single-site photoplethysmography (PPG) readings into wearable devices, although improved reliability and an understanding of BP estimation accuracy are essential. This review paper focuses on understanding the features of PPG associated with BP and examines the development of this technology over the 2010\&ndash;2019 period in terms of validation, sample size, diversity of subjects, and datasets used. Challenges and opportunities to move single-site PPG forward are also discussed.},

Of all PICU admissions, fluid overload or a requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a poor prognostic factor, resulting in death in 25-50 \% of such babies. For those who survive, RRT is supportive until kidney recovery, but up to 30 \% of babies may have chronic kidney sequelae. Owing to their size, neonates and small infants present specific challenges for dialysis. Dialysis technology was designed for use in adults and had to be adapted for pediatric use, creating a less than ideal treatment environment fraught with complications. Consequently, wherever possible, the vast majority of physicians default to peritoneal dialysis. Clinicians now have access to two new dialysis systems with technology specifically designed for use in babies ranging from 800 g to 8 kg: the CARPEDIEM and Nidus exhibit preliminary data that demonstrates both purification and ultrafiltration capability, with safety records that exceed any existing systems presently in practice. These are truly exciting times, as these systems have the potential to revolutionise how such babies in the PICU are treated.},

The meta-analysis aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the CDR for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in older populations.MethodsStudies examining the diagnostic accuracy of the CDR for MCI or dementia against reference standards were included from seven electronic databases. The bivariate analysis with a random-effects model was adopted to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity of the CDR for MCI and dementia.ResultsFifteen studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of the CDR-GS (n~=~13) or CDR-SB (n~=~5) for MCI or dementia were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the CDR-GS for MCI were 93\% and 97\%, respectively. With respect to dementia, the CDR-GS had superior pooled specificity compared to the CDR-SB (99\% vs. 94\%), while similar sensitivities were found between the CDR-GS and CDR-SB (both 87\%). Significant moderators of an old age, a high educational level, a high prevalence of MCI or dementia, being in a developing country, and a lack of informants' observations may affect the estimation of the sensitivity or specificity of the CDR.ConclusionsEvidence supports the CDR being useful for detecting MCI and dementia; applying the CDR for staging cognitive impairment in at risk populations should be considered. Furthermore, including objective observations from relevant informants or proxies to increase the accuracy of the CDR for dementia is suggested.},

The effect of the infrared (IR) and visible light (Vis) components of solar radiation on skin and their interaction with UV is less well known. This study compared the effects of physiologically relevant doses of complete (UV~+~Vis~+~IR) solar-simulated light and its individual components on matched primary dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes from human donors on three biomarkers of cellular damage (reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and nuclear DNA (nDNA) damage). There was a greater induction of ROS, mtDNA, and nDNA damage with the inclusion of the visible and IR components of solar-simulated light in primary fibroblast cells compared to primary keratinocytes (P~{$<~$}.001). Experiments using exposure to specific components of solar light alone or in combination showed that the UV, Vis, and IR components of solar light synergistically increased ROS generation in primary fibroblasts but not primary keratinocytes (P~{$<~$}.001). Skin cell lines were used to confirm these findings. These observations have important implications for different skin cell type responses to the individual and interacting components of solar light and therefore photodamage mechanisms and photoprotection interventions.},

This study evaluated midterm outcomes of BMSs vs CBE stents placed in the common iliac artery (CIA) for aortoiliac occlusive disease. METHODS: All endovascular interventions for symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease performed at a single institution from 2006 to 2012 were reviewed. Patients undergoing stent placement in the CIA segment were included in the analysis. Demographic data, TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification, stent type, patency, and limb reinterventions were compared. RESULTS: For treatment of de novo distal aorta or CIA stenosis, 254 procedures were performed in 162 patients. BMSs were used in 190 arteries; CBE stents were used in 64 arteries. There was no difference in age, gender, or TASC classification between the two groups. Mean follow-up was 22 ± 16 months. Primary patency, assisted patency, and secondary patency were significantly better in the BMS group. CIAs treated with covered stents were more likely at 1 year or longer to require repeated intervention (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95\% confidence interval, 1.2-5.3; P = .009). TASC classification did not predict need for reintervention in either group. Multivariate analysis revealed dual antiplatelet therapy to be the only other factor to affect patency during long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, BMSs had significantly better patency compared with CBE stents for treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease. A randomized trial comparing patency as well as restenosis rates with long-term follow-up is needed to determine if there is any benefit from use of covered stents in the aortoiliac segment.},

There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user friendly manner. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines efforts into one current, useful reporting guidance. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication.The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. A list of possible items based on a systematic review was created. A two round, modified Delphi panel consisting of representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, government, and the editorial community was conducted. Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed. The recommendations are contained in a user friendly, 24 item checklist. A copy of the statement, accompanying checklist, and this report can be found on the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluations Publication Guidelines Task Force website (http://www.ispor.org/TaskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp).We hope CHEERS will lead to better reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the CHEERS statement is being co-published across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups, to endorse CHEERS. The author team plans to review the checklist for an update in five years.},

In the present study, a quantitative system was developed to evaluate the voice range profile utilizing a personal computer. The area of the voice range profile was defined as the voice volume. This volume was analyzed in 137 males and 175 females who were treated for various dysphonias at Kyushu University between 1984 and 1990. Ten normal subjects served as controls. The voice volume in cases with voice disorders significantly decreased irrespective of the disease and sex. Furthermore, cases having better improvement after treatment showed a tendency for the voice volume to increase.

  abstract = {Molecular profiling, the classification of tissue or other specimens for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive purposes based on multiple gene expression, is a technology that holds major promise for optimizing the management of patients with cancer. However, the use of these tests for clinical decision making presents many challenges to overcome. Assay development and data analysis in this field have been largely exploratory, and leave numerous possibilities for the introduction of bias. Standardization of profiles remains the exception. Classifier performance is usually overinterpreted by presenting the results as p-values or multiplicative effects (e.g., relative risks), while the absolute sensitivity and specificity of classification remain modest at best, especially when tested in large validation samples. Validation has often been done with suboptimal attention to methodology and protection from bias. The postulated classifier performance may be inflated compared to what these profiles can achieve. With the exception of breast cancer, we have little evidence about the incremental discrimination that molecular profiles can provide versus classic risk factors alone. Clinical trials have started to evaluate the utility of using molecular profiles for breast cancer management. Until we obtain data from these trials, the impact of these tests and the net benefit under real-life settings remain unknown. Optimal incorporation into clinical practice is not straightforward. Finally, cost-effectiveness is difficult to appreciate until these other challenges are addressed. Overall, molecular profiling is a fascinating and promising technology, but its incorporation into clinical decision making requires careful planning and robust evidence.},

  abstract = {Background: When systematically comparing procedures and therapies in the setting of a comparative effectiveness review (CER), the evidence base often includes single group studies, those that evaluate a single intervention given to all subjects included in the study design. The utility and limitations of single group studies to resolve clinical questions that are inherently comparative in nature should be described clearly. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review the use and interpretation of single group studies in primary clinical research and to summarize current practices to using single group studies in CERs conducted by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Centers. Methods: We extracted information about the use of single group studies in all published CERs prepared for the AHRQ Effective Health Care (EHC) Program through January 2012. Summary descriptive statistics across the different reports were tabulated. Findings: Of 33 eligible reviews, 21 included single group studies. Ten used single group studies to report only harms, 2 reported only nonharm effects, while the remaining 9 reported both harms and nonharm effects. Ten of 21 did not provide the rationale for including single group studies. Of the 11 that did, the reasons cited included provision of supplementary long-term effect data on surgical interventions, hypothesis generation, and to address a paucity of existing comparative studies. Of the 12 CERs that did not include single group studies, 3 provided reasons for excluding these types of studies. They included specific concerns about confounding, avoidance of bias, and that sufficient data were expected from comparative studies. The terminology used to describe single group studies and their subtypes is not consistent across CERs. Conclusions/recommendations: The reporting of inclusion or exclusion of single group studies in the EHC Program's CERs is suboptimal. Our review of published CERs to date indicates that single group studies are commonly included in CERs, but the rationale for including them is not consistently reported, and the methods relevant to their use are not clearly defined. Clarity and transparency in the rationale for including or excluding single group studies in CERs should be promoted. A working group should be convened to develop guidance on the circumstances under which single group studies should be included or excluded from a CER, to discuss how they should be integrated with evidence from other designs and how they may inform the strength of evidence assessment.},

Patients were regularly followed up with evaluation of AF-related symptoms, a resting electrocardiogram (ECG), and interrogation of device memory. The incidence of AF recurrences lasting \&gt;48 h in asymptomatic patients presenting in sinus rhythm (SR) at the respective follow-up visit constituted the primary end point of this prospective study.Results During 19 ± 11 months, 678 follow-up visits were performed. Atrial fibrillation was documented in 51 patients (46\%) by ECG recording and in 97 patients (88\%) by a review of stored electrograms (p \&lt; 0.0001). Device interrogation revealed AF recurrences lasting \&gt;48 h in 50 patients, 19 of whom (38\%) were completely asymptomatic and in SR at subsequent follow-up. In 11 (16\%) of 67 patients with device-confirmed freedom from AF for ≥3 months, AF lasting \&gt;48 h recurred subsequently.Conclusions This prospective study demonstrates a high incidence of recurrent AF despite optimized antiarrhythmic therapy. Of particular note, AF relapses \&gt;48 h remained totally asymptomatic in a significant proportion of patients. Freedom from AF for ≥3 months did not preclude subsequent long-lasting AF recurrence.},

  abstract = {Most models of visual search, whether involving overt eye movements or covert shifts of attention, are based on the concept of a saliency map, that is, an explicit two-dimensional map that encodes the saliency or conspicuity of objects in the visual environment. Competition among neurons in this map gives rise to a single winning location that corresponds to the next attended target. Inhibiting this location automatically allows the system to attend to the next most salient location. We describe a detailed computer implementation of such a scheme, focusing on the problem of combining information across modalities, here orientation, intensity and color information, in a purely stimulus-driven manner. The model is applied to common psychophysical stimuli as well as to a very demanding visual search task. Its successful performance is used to address the extent to which the primate visual system carries out visual search via one or more such saliency maps and how this can be tested.

  abstract = {Biological time-series analysis is used to identify hidden dynamical patterns which could yield important insights into underlying physiological mechanisms. Such analysis is complicated by the fact that biological signals are typically both highly irregular and non-stationary, that is, their statistical character changes slowly or intermittently as a result of variations in background influences. Previous statistical analyses of heartbeat dynamics have identified long-range correlations and power-law scaling in the normal heartbeat, but not the phase interactions between the different frequency components of the signal. Here we introduce a new approach, based on the wavelet transform and an analytic signal approach, which can characterize non-stationary behaviour and elucidate such phase interactions. We find that, when suitably rescaled, the distributions of the variations in the beat-to-beat intervals for all healthy subjects are described by a single function stable over a wide range of timescales. However, a similar scaling function does not exist for a group with cardiopulmonary instability caused by sleep apnoea. We attribute the functional form of the scaling observed in the healthy subjects to underlying nonlinear dynamics, which seem to be essential to normal heart function. The approach introduced here should be useful in the analysis of other nonstationary biological signals.},

  abstract = {Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) involves the application of radiofrequency energy to visible proximal airways to selectively ablate airway smooth muscle. BT is the first nonpharmacologic interventional therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for severe asthma. This approval was based on the results of the pivotal Asthma Intervention Research (AIR)-2 trial, which is the only randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial of BT. The primary end point of the AIR-2 trial was improvement in the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). The results of the AIR-2 trial have generated enormous interest, controversy, and confusion regarding the true efficacy of BT for severe asthma. Current marketing of BT highlights its use for patients with "severe" asthma, which is interpreted by most practicing clinicians as meaning oral corticosteroid dependence, frequent exacerbations, or a significantly reduced FEV1 with a poor quality of life. Did the AIR-2 trial include patients with a low FEV1, oral steroid dependence, or frequent exacerbations? Did the trial show efficacy for any of the primary or secondary end points? The FDA approved the device based on the reduction in severe asthma exacerbations. However, were the rates of asthma exacerbations, ED visits, or hospitalizations truly different between the two groups, and was this type of analysis even justified given the original study design? This commentary is designed to specifically answer these questions and help the practicing clinician navigate the thermoplasty literature with confidence and clarity. We carefully dissect the design, conduct, and results of the AIR-2 trial and raise serious questions about the efficacy of bronchial thermoplasty.},

  abstract = {Objective Normal-hearing (NH) acuity and auditory feedback control are crucial for human voice production and articulation. The lack of auditory feedback in individuals with profound hearing impairment changes their vowel production. The purpose of this study was to compare Persian vowel production in deaf children with cochlear implants (CIs) and that in NH children. Methods The participants were 20 children (12 girls and 8 boys) with age range of 5 years; 1 month to 9 years. All patients had congenital hearing loss and received a multichannel CI at an average age of 3 years. They had at least 6 months experience of their current device (CI). The control group consisted of 20 NH children (12 girls and 8 boys) with age range of 5 to 9 years old. The two groups were matched by age. Participants were native Persian speakers who were asked to produce the vowels /i/, /e/, /æ/, /u/, /o/, and /a/. The averages for first formant frequency (F1) and second formant frequency (F2) of six vowels were measured using Praat software (Version 5.1.44, Boersma \& Weenink, 2012). The independent samples t test was conducted to assess the differences in F1 and F2 values and the area of the vowel space between the two groups. Results Mean values of F1 were increased in CI children; the mean values of F1 for vowel /i/ and /a/, F2 for vowel /a/ and /o/ were significantly different (P \textbackslash textless 0.05). The changes in F1 and F2 showed a centralized vowel space for CI children. Conclusions F1 is increased in CI children, probably because CI children tend to overarticulate. We hypothesis this is due to a lack of auditory feedback; there is an attempt by hearing-impaired children to compensate via proprioceptive feedback during articulatory process.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Zilver vascular stents (Cook Inc., Bloomington, Indiana) were placed in 151 consecutive patients whose iliac arteries remained stenotic after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Success at 2 years was determined by patency, ankle-brachial index (ABI) scores, and Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) scores. RESULTS: Patency, ABI measurements, and WIQ scores showed improvement at 2 years, compared with preprocedure measurements. Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall patency at 2 years was 90\% (n = 117). Significant improvement in ABI and WIQ scores was seen at 2 years, compared with preprocedural values (P \textbackslash textless .01). The 2-year overall success rate was 91\%. The degree of initial stenosis, stent location, and patient gender did not affect the success of the Zilver stent (P = .65, P = .58, and P = .77). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability of experiencing a major adverse event (MAE) related to the device or stent placement procedure by the 2-year follow-up was 2.7\%. CONCLUSIONS: The Zilver vascular stent remains durable at 2 years in regard to safety and clinical effectiveness, and is effective in the CIA and EIA both in male and female patients.},

In this study, we evaluated the process of skill acquisition for performing endotracheal intubation (ETI) in three emergency medicine (EM) residents over a 2 year period in their first 2 years of their EM residency. METHODS: We evaluated 342 ETI cases performed by three EM residents using the LC-CUSUM test according to their rate of success or failure of ETI. A 90\% success rate (SR) was chosen to define adequate performance and an SR of 80\% was considered inadequate. After the learning phase, the standard CUSUM test was applied to ensure that performance was maintained. RESULTS: The mean number of ETI cases required to reach the predefined level of performance was 74.7 (95\% CI 62.0 to 87.3). CUSUM tests confirmed that performance was maintained after the learning phase. CONCLUSIONS: By using the LC-CUSUM test, we were able to quantitatively monitor the acquisition of the skill of ETI by EM residents. The LC-CUSUM could be useful for monitoring the learning process for the training of airway management in the practice of EM.},

  abstract = {Echocardiographic follow-up of left ventricular (LV) volumes is difficult because of the test-retest variation of 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DE). We investigated whether the accuracy and reproducibility of real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) would make this modality more feasible for serial follow-up of LV measurements. We performed 2DE and RT3DE and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 50 patients with previous infarction and varying degrees of LV function (44 men; 61 +/- 11 years of age) at baseline and after 1-year follow-up. Images were obtained during breath-hold and measurements of LV volumes and ejection fraction were made offline. Over follow-up, end-diastolic volume decreased from 192 +/- 53 to 187 +/- 60 ml (p \textbackslash textless0.01), end-systolic volume decreased from 104 +/- 51 to 95 +/- 53 ml (p \textbackslash textless0.01), and ejection fraction increased from 48 +/- 12\% to 51 +/- 12\% (p \textbackslash textless0.01). MRI showed that LV mass shrank from 183 +/- 39 to 182 +/- 37 g (p \textbackslash textless0.01). The correlation between change in RT3DE and change in MRI was greater than the correlations of 2DE with MRI for measurement of end-diastolic volume (r = 0.47 vs 0.02, p \textbackslash textless0.01), end-systolic volume (r = 0.44 vs 0.17, p \textbackslash textless0.01), and ejection fraction (r = 0.58 vs -0.03, p \textbackslash textless0.01). The change in end-diastolic volume between baseline and follow-up with RT3DE (-4 +/- 20, p \textbackslash textless0.01) was similar to that with MRI but was unrecognized by 2DE (4 +/- 19, p = 0.09). There was good test-retest and inter- and intraobserver correlation within RT3DE for volumes, ejection fraction, and mass. In conclusion, if sequential measurement of LV volumes is used to guide management decisions, 3DE appears preferable to 2DE.},

  abstract = {Scoliosis-structural lateral curvature of the spine-affects around four children per 1,000. The MAGEC system comprises a magnetically distractible spinal rod implant and an external remote controller, which lengthens the rod; this system avoids repeated surgical lengthening. Rod implants brace the spine internally and are lengthened as the child grows, preventing worsening of scoliosis and delaying the need for spinal fusion. The Medical Technologies Advisory Committee at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) selected the MAGEC system for evaluation in a NICE medical technologies guidance. Six studies were identified by the sponsor (Ellipse Technologies Inc.) as being relevant to the decision problem. Meta-analysis was used to compare the clinical evidence results with those of one conventional growth rod study, and equal efficacy of the two devices was concluded. The key weakness was selection of a single comparator study. The External Assessment Centre (EAC) identified 16 conventional growth rod studies and undertook meta-analyses of relevant outcomes. Its critique highlighted limitations around study heterogeneity and variations in baseline characteristics and follow-up duration, precluding the ability to draw firm conclusions. The sponsor constructed a de novo costing model showing that MAGEC rods generated cost savings of \textbackslash pounds9,946 per patient after 6 years, compared with conventional rods. The EAC critiqued and updated the model structure and inputs, calculating robust cost savings of \textbackslash pounds12,077 per patient with MAGEC rods compared with conventional rods over 6 years. The year of valuation was 2012. NICE issued a positive recommendation as supported by the evidence (Medical Technologies Guidance 18).},

The objective was to create groups of patients who are homogeneous with respect to diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. METHODS: The frequency and consistency of potentially relevant diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision) and procedure (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification, 4th revision) codes were assessed in patients admitted to English National Health Service hospitals between April 2003 and March 2008. Administrative codes were compared with diagnosis and procedure codes to check that patients who had undergone emergency surgery for a ruptured AAA were admitted as an emergency. RESULTS: Of 20 290 patients undergoing AAA replacement, 19 250 (94·9 per cent) had a consistent diagnosis (unruptured or ruptured AAA); 79·3 per cent of patients with an emergency replacement were coded as having a ruptured AAA and 95·7 per cent of those with a non-emergency replacement as having an unruptured AAA. Of patients who had undergone emergency replacement of a ruptured AAA, 93·3 per cent were coded as having been admitted as an emergency. CONCLUSION: Coding consistency was high. The proposed framework could define homogeneous groups by combining diagnosis, procedure and administrative codes. It also allows an assessment of potential miscoding at national and hospital level.},

  abstract = {Objective: Bayesian analysis can incorporate clinicians' beliefs about treatment effectiveness into models that estimate treatment effects. Many elicitation methods are available, but it is unclear if any confer advantages based on principles of measurement science. We review belief-elicitation methods for Bayesian analysis and determine if any of them had an incremental value over the others based on its validity, reliability, and responsiveness. Study Design and Setting: A systematic review was performed. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, Current Index to Statistics, MathSciNet, and Zentralblatt Math were searched using the terms (prior OR prior probability distribution) AND (beliefs OR elicitation) AND (Bayes OR Bayesian). Studies were evaluated on: design, question stem, response options, analysis, consideration of validity, reliability, and responsiveness. Results: We identified 33 studies describing methods for elicitation in a Bayesian context. Elicitation occurred in cross-sectional studies (n = 30, 89\%), to derive point estimates with individual-level variation (n = 19; 58\%). Although 64\% (n = 21) considered validity, 24\% (n = 8) reliability, 12\% (n = 4) responsiveness of the elicitation methods, only 12\% (n = 4) formally tested validity, 6\% (n = 2) tested reliability, and none tested responsiveness. Conclusions: We have summarized methods of belief elicitation for Bayesian priors. The validity, reliability, and responsiveness of elicitation methods have been infrequently evaluated. Until comparative studies are performed, strategies to reduce the effects of bias on the elicitation should be used. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We compare thirteen different grayscale algorithms with four types of image descriptors and demonstrate that this assumption is wrong: not all color-to-grayscale algorithms work equally well, even when using descriptors that are robust to changes in illumination. These methods are tested using a modern descriptor-based image recognition framework, on face, object, and texture datasets, with relatively few training instances. We identify a simple method that generally works best for face and object recognition, and two that work well for recognizing textures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis remain unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) study, 358 patients were randomly assigned to TAVR or standard therapy. We report the 3-year outcomes on these patients, and the pooled outcomes for all randomly assigned inoperable patients (n=449) in PARTNER, as well, including the randomized portion of the continued access study (n=91). The 3-year mortality rate in the TAVR and standard therapy groups was 54.1\% and 80.9\%, respectively (P\textbackslash textless0.001; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95\% confidence interval, 0.41-0.68; P\textbackslash textless0.001). In survivors, there was significant improvement in New York Heart Association functional class sustained at 3 years. The cumulative incidence of strokes at 3-year follow-up was 15.7\% in TAVR patients versus 5.5\% in patients undergoing standard therapy (hazard ratio, 2.81; 95\% confidence interval, 1.26-6.26; P=0.012); however, the composite of death or strokes was significantly lower after TAVR versus standard therapy (57.4\% versus 80.9\%, P\textbackslash textless0.001; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95\% confidence interval, 0.46-0.77; P\textbackslash textless0.001). Echocardiography showed a sustained increase in aortic valve area and decrease in transvalvular gradient after TAVR. Analysis of the 449 pooled randomly assigned patients (TAVR, n=220; standard therapy, n=229) demonstrated significant improvement in all-cause mortality and functional status during early and 3-year follow-up. The results of the pooled cohort were similar to the results obtained from the pivotal PARTNER trial. CONCLUSIONS: TAVR resulted in better survival and functional status in inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis with durable hemodynamic benefit on long-term follow-up. However, high residual mortality, even in successfully treated TAVR patients, highlights the need for more strategic patient selection. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

  abstract = {Summary Background Based on the early results of the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) trial, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an accepted treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are not suitable for surgery. However, little information is available about the late clinical outcomes in such patients. Methods We did this randomised controlled trial at 21 experienced valve centres in Canada, Germany, and the USA. We enrolled patients with severe symptomatic inoperable aortic stenosis and randomly assigned (1:1) them to transfemoral TAVR or to standard treatment, which often included balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Patients and their treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation. The randomisation was done centrally, and sites learned of the assignment only after a patient had been screened, consented, and entered into the database. The primary outcome of the trial was all-cause mortality at 1 year in the intention-to-treat population, here we present the prespecified findings after 5 years. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00530894. Findings We screened 3015 patients, of whom 358 were enrolled (mean age 83 years, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 11??7\%, 54\% female). 179 were assigned to TAVR treatment and 179 were assigned to standard treatment. 20 patients crossed over from the standard treatment group and ten withdrew from study, leaving only six patients at 5 years, of whom five had aortic valve replacement treatment outside of the study. The risk of all-cause mortality at 5 years was 71??8\% in the TAVR group versus 93??6\% in the standard treatment group (hazard ratio 0??50, 95\% CI 0??39-0??65; p\textbackslash textless0??0001). At 5 years, 42 (86\%) of 49 survivors in the TAVR group had New York Heart Association class 1 or 2 symptoms compared with three (60\%) of five in the standard treatment group. Echocardiography after TAVR showed durable haemodynamic benefit (aortic valve area 1??52 cm\textbackslash textlesssup\textbackslash textgreater2\textbackslash textless/sup\textbackslash textgreater at 5 years, mean gradient 10??6 mm Hg at 5 years), with no evidence of structural valve deterioration. Interpretation TAVR is more beneficial than standard treatment for treatment of inoperable aortic stenosis. TAVR should be strongly considered for patients who are not surgical candidates for aortic valve replacement to improve their survival and functional status. Appropriate selection of patients will help to maximise the benefit of TAVR and reduce mortality from severe comorbidities. Funding Edwards Lifesciences.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Pain relief with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has focused historically on paresthesias overlapping chronically painful areas. A higher level evidence supports the use of SCS in treating leg pain than supports back pain, as it is difficult to achieve adequate paresthesia coverage, and then pain relief, in the low back region. In comparison, 10-kHz high-frequency (HF10 therapy) SCS therapy does not rely on intraoperative paresthesia mapping and remains paresthesia-free during therapy. OBJECTIVE To compare long-term results of HF10 therapy and traditional low-frequency SCS. METHODS A pragmatic randomized, controlled, pivotal trial with 24-month follow-up was conducted across 11 comprehensive pain treatment centers. Subjects had Visual Analog Scale scores of ≥5.0/10.0 cm for both back and leg pain, and were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive HF10 therapy or low-frequency SCS. The primary end point was a responder rate, defined as ≥50\% back pain reduction from baseline at 3 months with a secondary end point at 12 months (previously reported). In this article, 24-month secondary results are presented. Non-inferiority was first assessed, and if demonstrated the results were tested for superiority. RESULTS In the study, 198 subjects were randomized (101 HF10 therapy, 97 traditional SCS). One hundred seventy-one subjects (90 HF10 therapy, 81 traditional SCS) successfully completed a short-term trial and were implanted. Subjects averaged 54.9 ± 12.9 years old, 13.6 ± 11.3 years since diagnosis, 86.6\% had back surgery, 88.3\% were taking opioid analgesics. At 3 months, 84.5\% of implanted HF10 therapy subjects were responders for back pain and 83.1\% for leg pain, and 43.8\% of traditional SCS subjects were responders for back pain and 55.5\% for leg pain (P \textbackslash textless .001 for both back and leg pain comparisons, non-inferiority and superiority). At 24 months, more subjects were responders to HF10 therapy than traditional SCS (back pain: 76.5\% vs 49.3\%; 27.2\% difference, 95\% CI, 10.1\%-41.8\%; P \textbackslash textless .001 for non-inferiority and superiority; leg pain: 72.9\% vs 49.3\%; 23.6\% difference, 95\% CI, 5.9\%-38.6\%; P \textbackslash textless .001 for non-inferiority and P = .003 for superiority). Also at 24 months, back pain decreased to a greater degree with HF10 therapy (66.9\% ± 31.8\%) than traditional SCS (41.1\% ± 36.8\%, P \textbackslash textless .001 for non-inferiority and superiority). Leg pain also decreased to a greater degree with HF10 therapy (65.1\% ± 36.0\%) than traditional SCS (46.0\% ± 40.4\%, P \textbackslash textless .001 for non-inferiority and P = .002 for superiority). CONCLUSION This study demonstrates long-term superiority of HF10 therapy compared with traditional SCS in treating both back and leg pain. The advantages of HF10 therapy are anticipated to impact the management of chronic pain patients substantially.

  abstract = {A response to injury leading to intimal thickening and subsequent “restenosis” has limited the clinical efficiency of percutaneous coronary interventions ever since they have been used to treat symptomatic coronary artery disease. During the recent two decades a lot has been learned about the pathophysiology of the response to injury following different kinds of interventions. The predominant mechanism is activation of cells within the arterial wall, the adventitial layer, and the blood, namely arterial smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, monocytes, lymphocytes, and leucocytes. Once activated by arterial injury, most of these cells will undergo a change of phenotype and express a variety of growth factors and hormones leading to complex interactions, which result in cellular migration and proliferation. As a result, much research has focused on modulation or inhibition of cell proliferation and, although some compounds were effective in animal models, they were not successful in human restenosis trials.One explanation for this failure is a lack of appropriate animal models, with species related specific differences in cell activation and cellular responses, which negates comparison with human atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Nevertheless, we have learned from this experimental work that the response to injury is rather specific for each kind of injury. The time course might be quite different—for example, a short burst of proliferation ensues after conventional balloon angioplasty, while a long lasting proliferative response is induced by implantation of metallic stents. Multiple attempts had been made to ameliorate the arterial response to injury by using different mechanical techniques for ablating or debulking atherosclerotic tissue before dilatation of the vessel was performed. Although attractive in theory, these techniques, like excimer laser angioplasty and directional or rotational atherectomy, have not influenced restenosis rates and hence have not led to a major change in practice in the interventional catheterisation laboratories.

Hierarchical models were used to synthesize available evidence.The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of FIT for detecting CRC or AN.We included 12 studies (6204 participants). Seven studies were deemed at high or unclear risk of bias. The average sensitivity of FIT for CRC was 93\% (95\% CI, 53\%-99\%), and the average specificity was 91\% (95\% CI, 89\%-92\%), yielding a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 10.30 (CI 7.7-13.9) and a negative likelihood ratio (LR−) of 0.08 (95\% CI, 0.01-0.75) (GRADE: very low). The average sensitivity of FIT for AN was 48\% (95\% CI, 39\%-57\%); and the average specificity was 93\% (95\% CI, 91\%-94\%), yielding an LR+ of 6.55 (95\% CI, 5.0-8.5) and an LR− of 0.57 (95\% CI, 0.48-0.67) (GRADE: very low). Subgroup analyses indicated that FIT cutoff values between 15- and 25-μg/g feces provided the best combination of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CRC (93\% and 94\%, respectively). Quantitative and 1-sample FIT showed adequate test performance, but data on other FIT brands and multiple samples were insufficient.The FIT has high overall diagnostic accuracy for CRC but moderate accuracy for AN in patients at above-average personal or familial risk. Heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals limit the trustworthiness of our findings.},

Loss of signal due to blood flow, partial volume effects and significant variation of surface grey value appearance make this a difficult problem. We integrate various sources of prior knowledge learned from annotated image data into a deformable model. Inter-individual shape variation is represented by a statistical point distribution model, and the spatial relationship of the epi- and endocardium is modeled by adapting two coupled triangular surface meshes. To robustly accommodate variation of grey value appearance around the myocardiac surface, a prior parametric spatially varying feature model is established by classification of grey value surface profiles. Quantitative validation of 121 3D MRI datasets in end-diastolic (end-systolic) phase demonstrates accuracy and robustness, with 2.45 mm (2.84 mm) mean deviation from manual segmentation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: New electronic devices offer an opportunity within routine primary care settings for improving the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), which is a common cardiac arrhythmia and a modifiable risk factor for stroke. We aimed to assess the performance of a modified blood pressure (BP) monitor and two single-lead ECG devices, as diagnostic triage tests for the detection of AF. SETTING: 6 General Practices in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 1000 ambulatory patients aged 75 years and over. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparative diagnostic accuracy of modified BP monitor and single-lead ECG devices, compared to reference standard of 12-lead ECG, independently interpreted by cardiologists. RESULTS: A total of 79 participants (7.9\%) had AF diagnosed by 12-lead ECG. All three devices had a high sensitivity (93.9-98.7\%) and are useful for ruling out AF. WatchBP is a better triage test than Omron autoanalysis because it is more specific-89.7\% (95\% CI 87.5\% to 91.6\%) compared to 78.3\% (95\% CI 73.0\% to 82.9\%), respectively. This would translate into a lower follow-on ECG rate of 17\% to rule in/rule out AF compared to 29.7\% with the Omron text message in the study population. The overall specificity of single-lead ECGs analysed by a cardiologist was 94.6\% for Omron and 90.1\% for Merlin. CONCLUSIONS: WatchBP performs better as a triage test for identifying AF in primary care than the single-lead ECG monitors as it does not require expertise for interpretation and its diagnostic performance is comparable to single-lead ECG analysis by cardiologists. It could be used opportunistically to screen elderly patients for undiagnosed AF at regular intervals and/or during BP measurement.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the term medical physics usually refers to the work of physicists employed in hospitals, who are concerned mainly with medical applications of radiation, diagnostic imaging, and clinical measurement. This involvement in clinical work began barely 100 years ago, but the relation between physics and medicine has a much longer history. In this report, I have traced this history from the earliest recorded period, when physical agents such as heat and light began to be used to diagnose and treat disease. Later, great polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci and Alhazen used physical principles to begin the quest to understand the function of the body. After the scientific revolution in the 17th century, early medical physicists developed a purely mechanistic approach to physiology, whereas others applied ideas derived from physics in an effort to comprehend the nature of life itself. These early investigations led directly to the development of specialties such as electrophysiology, biomechanics, and ophthalmology. Physics-based medical technology developed rapidly during the 19th century, but it was the revolutionary discoveries about radiation and radioactivity at the end of the century that ushered in a new era of radiation-based medical diagnosis and treatment, thereby giving rise to the modern medical physics profession. Subsequent developments in imaging in particular have revolutionised the practice of medicine. We now stand on the brink of a new revolution in post-genomic personalised medicine, with physics-based techniques again at the forefront. As before, these techniques are often the unpredictable fruits of earlier investment in basic physics research.},

  abstract = {Many extensions of survival models based on the Cox proportional hazards approach have been proposed to handle clustered or multiple event data. Of particular note are five Cox-based models for recurrent event data: Andersen and Gill (AG); Wei, Lin and Weissfeld (WLW); Prentice, Williams and Peterson, total time (PWP-CP) and gap time (PWP-GT); and Lee, Wei and Amato (LWA). Some authors have compared these models by observing differences that arise from fitting the models to real and simulated data. However, no attempt has been made to systematically identify the components of the models that are appropriate for recurrent event data. We propose a systematic way of characterizing such Cox-based models using four key components: risk intervals; baseline hazard; risk set, and correlation adjustment. From the definitions of risk interval and risk set there are conceptually seven such Cox-based models that are permissible, five of which are those previously identified. The two new variant models are termed the 'total time - restricted' (TT-R) and 'gap time - unrestricted' (GT-UR) models. The aim of the paper is to determine which models are appropriate for recurrent event data using the key components. The models are fitted to simulated data sets and to a data set of childhood recurrent infectious diseases. The LWA model is not appropriate for recurrent event data because it allows a subject to be at risk several times for the same event. The WLW model overestimates treatment effect and is not recommended. We conclude that PWP-GT and TT-R are useful models for analysing recurrent event data, providing answers to slightly different research questions. Further, applying a robust variance to any of these models does not adequately account for within-subject correlation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several authors have developed and applied methods to routine data sets to identify the nature and rate of complications following interventional procedures. But, to date, there has been no systematic search for such methods. The objective of this article was to find, classify and appraise published methods, based on analysis of clinical codes, which used routine healthcare databases in a United Kingdom setting to identify complications resulting from interventional procedures. METHODS: A literature search strategy was developed to identify published studies that referred, in the title or abstract, to the name or acronym of a known routine healthcare database and to complications from procedures or devices. The following data sources were searched in February and March 2013: Cochrane Methods Register, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, Econlit, EMBASE, Health Management Information Consortium, Health Technology Assessment database, MathSciNet, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in-process, OAIster, OpenGrey, Science Citation Index Expanded and ScienceDirect. Of the eligible papers, those which reported methods using clinical coding were classified and summarised in tabular form using the following headings: routine healthcare database; medical speciality; method for identifying complications; length of follow-up; method of recording comorbidity. The benefits and limitations of each approach were assessed. RESULTS: From 3688 papers identified from the literature search, 44 reported the use of clinical codes to identify complications, from which four distinct methods were identified: 1) searching the index admission for specified clinical codes, 2) searching a sequence of admissions for specified clinical codes, 3) searching for specified clinical codes for complications from procedures and devices within the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) coding scheme which is the methodology recommended by NHS Classification Service, and 4) conducting manual clinical review of diagnostic and procedure codes. CONCLUSIONS: The four distinct methods identifying complication from codified data offer great potential in generating new evidence on the quality and safety of new procedures using routine data. However the most robust method, using the methodology recommended by the NHS Classification Service, was the least frequently used, highlighting that much valuable observational data is being ignored.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objectives To assess the safety of paediatric tonsillectomy procedures conducted in NHS hospitals in England between 2008 and 2019. Design Retrospective observational cohort study using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. Setting Acute NHS trusts in England conducting paediatric tonsillectomy procedures. Participants Children (≤16~years old) undergoing bilateral tonsillectomy. Main outcome measures Number of tonsillectomies performed per year by procedural method. In-hospital complications including return to theatre for arrest of haemorrhage. Readmission within 28~days, including those for pain, haemorrhage and surgical arrest of haemorrhage. Long-term outcomes: all-cause mortality, revision tonsillectomy. Results A total of 318~453 paediatric tonsillectomies were performed from 2008 to 2019:278,772 dissection (87.5\%) and 39~681 coblation (12.5\%). The proportion of tonsillectomy performed using coblation increased from 7\% in 2008/9 to 27\% in 2018/9. Five patients died in hospital (including 4 due to respiratory complications). In-hospital complications occurred in 4202 children (1.3\%), with the most frequent being haemorrhage. Within 28~days of tonsillectomy, 28~170 patients (8.8\%) were readmitted and 7 deaths occurred. Readmission rates for haemorrhage and pain have increased since 2008. The proportion of children undergoing revision tonsillectomy procedures within 5~years following coblation tonsillectomy (1.4\%) was approximately double that of dissection (0.6\%). Conclusions Clinical practice of paediatric tonsillectomy has changed in England over the past 11~years. The overall mortality rate associated with the procedure is 0.0037\%. Differences in outcomes have been identified for different procedural methods. However, routine administrative data are limited in differentiating procedural detail (eg we are unable to differentiate intra or extra-capsular techniques from current clinical coding of tonsillectomy procedures). Therefore, prospective national data collection or more granular clinical coding is essential to capture relative outcomes of the different tonsillectomy methods and techniques being used in the NHS.},

Even so, this critical test is underutilized. The purpose of this review is to summarize available evidence associated with ABI methodology variances, ABI usage in the treatment of PAD, and ABI efficacy in predicting cardiovascular disease. This review further evaluates how ABI is used in the prognosis and follow-up of lower extremity arterial disease.We reviewed the most current American College of Cardiology guidelines for the management of PAD, the Trans Atlantic Intersociety Consensus (TASC) working group recommendations, and searched the Medline for the following words: ankle brachial index, ABI sensitivity and specificity, and peripheral arterial disease.The ABI is a simple, noninvasive clinical test that should not only be applied to diagnose PAD, but also to provide important prognostic information about future cardiovascular events. Although the ABI has been employed in clinical practice for some time, our review of various studies reveals a lack of standardization regarding both the method of measuring ABI and the cutoff point for abnormal ABI. It is extremely important that we understand all aspects of this crucial test, as it is now being recommended as part of a patient's routine health risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Background:  Negative-pressure wound therapy with instillation is a novel wound therapy that combines negative pressure with instillation of a topical solution. Methods: This retrospective, historical, cohort-control study examined the impact of negative-pressure wound therapy with and without instillation. Results: One hundred forty-two patients (negative-pressure wound therapy, n = 74; therapy with instillation, 6-minute dwell time, n = 34; and therapy with instillation, 20-minute dwell time, n = 34) were included in the analysis. Number of operative visits was significantly lower for the 6- and 20-minute dwell time groups (2.4 ± 0.9 and 2.6 ± 0.9, respectively) compared with the no-instillation group (3.0 ± 0.9) (p ≤ 0.05). Hospital stay was significantly shorter for the 20-minute dwell time group (11.4 ± 5.1 days) compared with the no-instillation group (14.92 ± 9.23 days) (p ≤ 0.05). Time to final surgical procedure was significantly shorter for the 6- and 20-minute dwell time groups (7.8 ± 5.2 and 7.5 ± 3.1 days, respectively) compared with the no-instillation group (9.23 ± 5.2 days) (p ≤ 0.05). Percentage of wounds closed before discharge and culture improvement for Gram-positive bacteria was significantly higher for the 6-minute dwell time group (94 and 90 percent, respectively) compared with the no-instillation group (62 and 63 percent, respectively) (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion: The authors’ results suggest that negative-pressure wound therapy with instillation (6- or 20-minute dwell time) is more beneficial than standard negative-pressure wound therapy for the adjunctive treatment of acutely and chronically infected wounds that require hospital admission.

A variety of solutions have been reported, with topical antiseptics as the most frequently chosen option. The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of normal saline versus an antiseptic solution for negative-pressure wound therapy with instillation for the adjunctive treatment of infected wounds. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, effectiveness study comparing 0.9\% normal saline versus 0.1\% polyhexanide plus 0.1\% betaine for the adjunctive treatment of infected wounds that required hospital admission and operative débridement. One hundred twenty-three patients were eligible, with 100 patients randomized for the intention-to-treat analysis and 83 patients for the per-protocol analysis. The surrogate outcomes measured were number of operative visits, length of hospital stay, time to final surgical procedure, proportion of closed or covered wounds, and proportion of wounds that remained closed or covered at the 30-day follow-up. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the demographic profiles in the two cohorts except for a larger proportion of male patients (p = 0.004). There was no statistically significant difference in the surrogate outcomes with the exception of the time to final surgical procedure favoring normal saline (p = 0.038). Conclusion: The authors’ results suggest that 0.9\% normal saline may be as effective as an antiseptic (0.1\% polyhexanide plus 0.1\% betaine) for negative-pressure wound therapy with instillation for the adjunctive inpatient management of infected wounds.

  abstract = {Abstract Presence of bacteria in wounds can delay healing. Addition of a regularly instilled topical solution over the wound during negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) may reduce bioburden levels compared with standard NPWT alone. We performed a prospective, randomised, multi-centre, post-market trial to compare effects of NPWT with instillation and dwell of polyhexamethylene biguanide solution vs NPWT without instillation therapy in wounds requiring operative debridement. Results showed a significantly greater mean decrease in total bacterial counts from time of initial surgical debridement to first dressing change in NPWT plus instillation (n = 69) subjects compared with standard NPWT (n = 63) subjects (?0.18 vs 0.6 log10 CFU/g, respectively). There was no significant difference between the groups in the primary endpoint of required inpatient operating room debridements after initial debridement. Time to readiness for wound closure/coverage, proportion of wounds closed, and incidence of wound complications were similar. NPWT subjects had 3.1 times the risk of re-hospitalisation compared with NPWT plus instillation subjects. This study provides a basis for exploring research options to understand the impact of NPWT with instillation on wound healing.},

  abstract = {A detailed appreciation of the left atrial/pulmonary venous (LA/PV) anatomy may be important in improving the safety and success of catheter ablation for AF. The aim of this randomized study was to determine the impact of computed tomographic (CT) integration into an electroanatomic mapping (EAM) system on clinical outcome in patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF).Eighty patients with AF were randomized to undergo first-time wide encirclement of ipsilateral PV pairs using EAM alone (40 patients) or with CT (40 patients, Cartomerge®). Wide encirclement of the pulmonary veins was performed using irrigated radiofrequency ablation with the electrophysiological endpoint of electrical isolation (EI). The primary endpoint was single-procedure success at 6 month follow up. Acute and long-term procedural outcomes were also determined. There was no significant difference in single procedure success between EAM (56\%) and cavotricuspid isthmus image (CTI) (50\%) groups (P = 0.9). Acute procedural outcomes (EI, PV reconnection, sinus rhythm restored by ablation in persistent AF), fluoroscopy, and procedure durations (EI of right PVs, EI of left PVs, total) did not differ significantly between EAM and CTI groups.Image integration to guide catheter ablation for AF did not significantly improve the clinical outcome. Achieving PV EI is the critical determinant of procedural success rather than the mapping tools used to achieve it.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Manifestations of core social deficits in autism are more pronounced in everyday settings than in explicit experimental tasks. To bring experimental measures in line with clinical observation, we report a novel method of quantifying atypical strategies of social monitoring in a setting that simulates the demands of daily experience. Enhanced ecological validity was intended to maximize between-group effect sizes and assess the predictive utility of experimental variables relative to outcome measures of social competence. METHODS: While viewing social scenes, eye-tracking technology measured visual fixations in 15 cognitively able males with autism and 15 age-, sex-, and verbal IQ-matched control subjects. We reliably coded fixations on 4 regions: mouth, eyes, body, and objects. Statistical analyses compared fixation time on regions of interest between groups and correlation of fixation time with outcome measures of social competence (ie, standardized measures of daily social adjustment and degree of autistic social symptoms). RESULTS: Significant between-group differences were obtained for all 4 regions. The best predictor of autism was reduced eye region fixation time. Fixation on mouths and objects was significantly correlated with social functioning: increased focus on mouths predicted improved social adjustment and less autistic social impairment, whereas more time on objects predicted the opposite relationship. CONCLUSIONS: When viewing naturalistic social situations, individuals with autism demonstrate abnormal patterns of social visual pursuit consistent with reduced salience of eyes and increased salience of mouths, bodies, and objects. Fixation times on mouths and objects but not on eyes are strong predictors of degree of social competence.},

We aimed at comparing health-related quality of life and ABI in a cohort of cardiovascular risk persons in a general population. Methods: SF-36 questionnaire was completed and ABI measured from 915 individuals aged 45-70 years with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, newly detected diabetes, body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2), or a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease death of 5\% or more according to the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) system. None of the subjects had symptoms of intermittent claudication. Results: The prevalence of PAD (defined as ABI ≤0.90) and borderline PAD (defined as ABI 0.91-1.00) were 5\% (95\% CI 4-7\%) and 20\% (95\% CI 18⊟23\%), respectively. Patients with PAD had significantly lower quality of life dimension scores for physical functioning, role-physical, general health, and vitality than subjects with normal ABI. Among those with borderline PAD, quality of life was reduced on the general health perception compared to subjects with normal ABI. Conclusion: Health-related quality of life of individuals with asymptomatic or atypical PAD or borderline PAD is worse than that of individuals with normal ABI. The level of ABI is independently related to physical functioning.},

For both the intraclass and weighted kappas, we address continuing problems with kappas. There are serious problems with using the K x M intraclass (K\textbackslash textgreater2) or the various K x M weighted kappas for K\textbackslash textgreater2 or M\textbackslash textgreater2 in any context, either because they convey incomplete and possibly misleading information, or because other approaches are preferable to their use.

  abstract = {Regression analyses are perhaps the most widely used statistical tools in medical research. Centring in regression analyses seldom appears to be covered in training and is not commonly reported in research papers. Centring is the process of selecting a reference value for each predictor and coding the data based on that reference value so that each regression coefficient that is estimated and tested is relevant to the research question. Using non-centred data in regression analysis, which refers to the common practice of entering predictors in their original score format, often leads to inconsistent and misleading results. There is very little cost to unnecessary centring, but the costs of not centring when it is necessary can be major. Thus, it would be better always to centre in regression analyses. We propose a simple default centring strategy: (1) code all binary independent variables +1/2; (2) code all ordinal independent variables as deviations from their median; (3) code all 'dummy variables' for categorical independent variables having m possible responses as 1 - 1/m and -1/m instead of 1 and 0; (4) compute interaction terms from centred predictors. Using this default strategy when there is no compelling evidence to centre protects against most errors in statistical inference and its routine use sensitizes users to centring issues.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Zilver vascular stent in the treatment of de novo or restenotic lesions in the external and common iliac arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Regardless of the results of an initial percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), 151 consecutive patients were implanted with Zilver vascular stents (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) in up to two stenotic (:510 cm) or occluded (:55 cm) atherosclerotic lesions of the external or common iliac arteries. The primary endpoint was the rate of major adverse events within 9 months after the procedure. Major adverse events were defined as death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, and limb loss. Secondary endpoints included acute procedural success, 30-day clinical success, 9-month patency rate, 9-month functional status (on the basis of the validated Walking Impairment Questionnaire), and ankle-brachial index (ABI). Results of 1-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up are reported. RESULTS: The 9-month device and/or procedural-related major adverse event rate (adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee) was 2.7\%. The all-cause major adverse event rate was 7.5\%. Both rates were substantially below the prespecified objective performance criterion of 16\%. The acute procedure success rate and 30-day clinical success rate were 98.0\% and 94.0\%, respectively. The 9-month patency rate, measured with duplex ultrasonography, was 92.9\%. Significant improvement in the ABI and walking distance and walking speed scores, relative to preprocedural values, was seen at 1 month and was maintained through 9-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The Zilver vascular stent is safe and effective as an adjunct to PTA in the treatment of symptomatic disease of the iliac arteries.},

  abstract = {Ambulatory long-term motility recording is used increasingly for evaluation of esophageal function. The enormous amount of motility data recorded by this method demands subsequent computer analysis. One of the most crucial steps of this analysis becomes the process of automatic selection of relevant pressure peaks at the various recording levels. Until now, this selection has been performed entirely by rule-based systems, requiring each pressure deflection to fit within predefined rigid numerical limits in order to be detected. However, due to great variations in the shapes of the pressure curves generated by muscular contractions, rule-based criteria do not always select the pressure events most relevant for further analysis. We have therefore been searching for a new concept for automatic event recognition. The present study describes a new system, based on the method of neurocomputing. A large sample of normal esophageal pressure deflections was used as a “learning set,” and the performance of the trained neural networks was subsequently verified on different sets of data from normal subjects. Our trained networks detected pressure deflections with sensitivities of 0.79–0.99 and accuracies of 0.89–0.98, depending on the recording level within the esophageal lumen. The neural networks often recognized peaks that clearly represented true contractions but that had been rejected by a rule-based system. We conclude that neural networks have potentials for automatic detections of esophageal, and possibly also other kinds of gastrointestinal, pressure variations.},

Stents have been recommended to correct procedural complications and improve long-term patency. Many series advocate routine stent placement after an otherwise uncomplicated PTA (primary stenting) in an attempt to prevent recurrent disease. Currently, many physicians in the United States seem to use stents in the iliac artery more liberally, even on a routine basis. There is little evidence to support this practice, however. It is still unclear whether a stent should be inserted primarily or selectively. This article provides the data from an 11-year experience of angioplasty with selective stenting for iliac artery occlusive lesions and reviews the current literatures on the iliac artery stent placement.},

  abstract = {Chronic transfusion is indicated in the treatment and prevention of sickle cell disease (SCD) related-complications. Red blood cell exchange (RBCX) is preferred over top-up transfusion as it enables iron balance and rapid reduction of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) without increasing blood viscosity. RBCX can be done manually by sequential phlebotomy and transfusion or by automated apheresis, but the two methods have not been formally compared. Bart's Health NHS Trust (BHT) performs manual RBCX and Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Trust (GSTT) automated RBCX. Manual RBCX consists of isovolumetric exchange 15 to 20 mL/kg of venesected blood for normal saline and packed RBC, generally at a 1:1 ratio. Automated RBCX utilizes the Spectra Optia Apheresis System with a fractional cell remaining between 24 and 44, end Hct within 0.02 of pre-RBCX Hct, and a fluid replacement balance of 100\%. The indications for RBCX and pre-RBCX HbS or hemoglobin SC (HbSC) target (30\% or 50\%, depending on indication) are the same in both units. All packed RBC were leukodepleted, HbS negative, 7 days old, and phenotypically matched for C, D, E, and Kell. A retrospective observational cohort study as part of a quality assurance audit was conducted examining all SCD patients attending regular RBCX at BHT and GSTT between 1 May 2011 and 30 April 2012. Fifty-one patients (21 manual, 30 automated), totaling 401 RBCX sessions were included. Ten patients in the manual group and 7 patients in the automated group targeted an HbS of \textbackslash textless 30\%, while the rest were targeted to \textbackslash textless 50\%. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Peripheral vein was the most common method of cannulation in manual RBCX while temporary central venous catheterization was most common in automated RBCX (P \textbackslash textless 0.0001). Time interval differed between manual and automated RBCX (median 4.4 vs. 7.1 weeks, P \textbackslash textless 0.0001). Both groups consistently achieved a post-RBCX Hct \textbackslash textless 0.350. More patients on automated RBCX were able to consistently achieve their prescribed HbS or HbSC target (defined as \textbackslash textgreater 2/3 of RBCX sessions) than on manual RBCX (37\% vs. 10\%, unadjusted OR 5.5, 95\% CI 1.07 - 28.22, P = 0.048). When adjusted for the prescribed pre-RBCX HbS or HbSC target, the Mantel-Haenszel OR estimate was 4.72 (95\% CI 0.885 - 25.17). Older age was also associated with consistently achieving the prescribed HbS or HbSC target (P = 0.010 on multivariable logistric regression). Although the yearly volume of RBC and donor units used were significantly higher in the automated group (241.1 mL/kg/year and 55 units/year) compared to the manual group (127 mL/kg/year and 32 units/year), there was no difference in the rate of allo-antibody formation. There was no difference in the mean ferritin trend between manual and automated RBCX in non-chelated patients (-0.068 +/- 1.439 vs. -0.297 +/- 2.027 ug/L/day, P = 0.439). Automated RBCX was better at maintaining a near zero iron balance than manual RBCX due to considerable individual variability in the manual group (kurtosis statistic 13.221 +/- 0.935 SE vs. 0.398 +/- 1.121 SE). It took a significantly longer time to perform a manual RBCX session than an automated one (257 min. vs. 115 min.). There was no significant difference in the number of adverse events. The number of RBCX sessions that had to be converted to top-up transfusions in the manual group because of low pre-RBCX haematocrit far exceeded that of the automated group (11 vs. 0 sessions). None of the patients in either group had new or progressive neurological events. Manual RBCX, despite an optimized protocol and strict adherence to treatement, is inferior to automated RBCX in being able to consistently achieve the prescribed HbS target, although consistent adherence with automated RBCX can also be challenging. Automated RBCX requires less time to perform than manual RBCX, but involves higher RBC use and more donor exposure. Adverse events and antibody formation are the same for both methods. Automated RBCX can maintain a near zero iron balance in most patients without the use of iron chelation and with less individual variability than manual RBCX. The results suggest that automated RBCX is the preferred RBC exchange method in controlling HbS in SCD patients. Further longitudinal study is required to determine whether a better control of HbS translates into differences in patient-related outcomes},

Automated myocardial contour delineation often suffers from misalignment of slices, nonuniform coil sensitivity, blood-flow-related inter- and intraslice intensity inhomogeneities, blurring due to motion, partial voluming, and a need to circumscribe the papillary muscles and the trabeculae. In this paper, we propose a novel method for data-driven localization and segmentation of the left ventricle in the cine-MR images toward automated computation of ejection fraction (EF). Our hybrid segmentation method combines intensity- and texture-based fuzzy affinity maps obtained from a novel multiclass, multifeature fuzzy connectedness method with dynamic-programming-based boundary detection to delineate the myocardial contours. Bland-Altman analysis indicates that the mean biases of the end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and EF estimates of our method are comparable to the interobserver variability when compared with the annotations from two experts.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The present study examined the relationship between hospital and surgeon coronary artery bypass grafting procedural volume, mortality, morbidity, and National Quality Forum care processes in a universitybased community hospital quality improvement program. Methods: The study population consisted of 2218 consecutive patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from 2007 to 2009 in a university-based quality improvement program that emphasizes involvement of all surgeons in the academic quality endeavor. The endpoints included operative mortality, major morbidity, and National Quality Forum-endorsed process measures as defined by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. The procedural volume was analyzed as a categorical and continuous variable using general estimating equations, which accounted for clustering effects and which were adjusted for Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk scores and the propensity for operation in a low-versus high-volume program. Results: The annual program volume ranged from 67 to 292 (median, 136; interquartile range, 88-224) and surgeon volume from 1 to 124 (median, 58; interquartile range, 30-89). The mortality rate among the hospitals was 0.47\% to 2.23\% (0.8\% overall), and the observed/expected mortality ranged from 0 to 1.20 (0.41 overall). When comparing low-volume (\textbackslash textless200 cases/year) and high-volume centers, no difference was found in the mortality (odds ratio \{[\}OR], 1.08; 95\% confidence interval \{[\}CI], 0.46-2.54, P = .85), morbidity (OR, 1.34; 95\% CI, 0.73-2.43), or any of the medication process measures. No difference was found in mortality (OR, 1.59; 95\% CI, 0.81-3.13; P = .18), morbidity (OR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 0.86-1.66; P = .28), or medication failure (OR, 0.57, 95\% CI, 0.3-1.10; P = .10) between the high-and low-volume surgeons (\textbackslash textless 87). After adjustment for both the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score and the propensity score, no association was found for either hospital or surgeon volume with mortality or morbidity. However, a lack of compliance with National Quality Forum measures was highly predictive of morbidity (OR, 1.51; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.93; P = .001), regardless of volume, even after adjustment for predicted risk. Conclusions: In the setting of a university-based community hospital quality improvement program, excellent surgical results can consistently be obtained even in relatively low-volume programs. The surgical outcomes were not associated with program or surgeon volume, but were directly correlated with the focus on quality as manifested by compliance with evidence-based quality standards. Meaningful university affiliation might represent a newquality paradigm for cardiac surgery in the community hospital setting. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2012; 143:287-93)},

Compared with women with GFR ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for any first cardiovascular disease were 0.95 (95\% CI 0.83 to 1.08), 0.84 (0.70 to 1.00), and 1.00 (0.79 to 1.27) among women with GFR of 75-89.9, 60-74.9, and \&lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively; the equivalent hazard ratios for all cause mortality were 0.93 (0.79 to 1.09), 1.03 (0.85 to 1.26), and 1.09 (0.83 to 1.45). Similar null findings were observed for myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularisation, and non-cardiovascular death. However, an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease was found among women with GFR \&lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (hazard ratio 1.68 (1.02 to 2.79)).Conclusions In this large cohort of women, a glomerular filtration rate \&lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease death but not other cardiovascular disease events or non-cardiovascular disease mortality. We observed no increase in risk of any of the outcomes among women with less severe impairment of kidney function.}

  abstract = {Background: Asthma management in an outpatient setting is best accomplished by clinical evaluation coupled with spirometry and symptom evaluation, but these assessments do not provide information about airway inflammation. Exhaled nitric oxide (fraction of exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO]) measures T-helper cell type 2-mediated airway inflammation and may be a useful adjunct in asthma management. Objective: To determine whether the use of FeNO in the specialist management of asthma results in more effective and cost-effective treatment decisions. Methods: Fifty subjects 7 to 60 years old with established asthma participated in this observational study. Subjects were evaluated by clinical examination, spirometry, and symptom assessment using the Asthma Control Test, and clinicians estimated airway inflammation and made treatment decisions based on these assessments. Then, FeNO was measured, and changes in therapy based on FeNO levels were documented. The estimated cost impact of using FeNO was calculated presuming ongoing FeNO use in patient management. Results: Without FeNO, the clinician's assessment of airway inflammation was incorrectly classified in 50\% of subjects. FeNO results substantially altered treatment decisions in more than one third of subjects, notably medication augmentation in 10 (20\%) and medication decreases in 8 (16\%). Use of FeNO in addition to standard of care was estimated to save \$629 per subject per year. Conclusion: Measurement of FeNO augments routine clinical assessment of asthma by measuring airway inflammation. Knowledge of FeNO affects medication treatment decisions to augment or decrease pharmacotherapy, which has important long-term asthma management implications, most notably the potential to lower the costs and morbidity associated with asthma exacerbation.

  abstract = {The foramen ovale, while vital to our formative development, assumes mischievous potential if it persists post-utero. Similar to other vestigial structures, presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) appears to carry no physiologic or survival benefit for normal individuals. In states of abnormal right sided cardiac or pulmonary vascular capacitance or resistance, PFO has been implicated in worsening hypoxaemia caused by right to left intracardiac passage of deoxygenated blood (see box). More recently, a causative role of PFO in much more commonly occurring syndromes, including embolic ischaemic stroke, migraine with aura, and cerebral and cutaneous decompression disease, has been suggested. Highlighting cryptogenic embolic stroke associated with PFO, we will systematically review the evidence for these relations, discuss therapeutic potentials, and propose guidelines for therapeutic decisions as we await the completion of randomised controlled interventional trials. Incidence Stroke databases suggest that despite intensive evaluation, approximately 40\% of all patients suffering ischaemic strokes (80\% of all stroke victims) remain without clearly identifiable precipitant or cause (2002 heart and stroke statistical update, American Heart Association). In 1989, Webster and Lechat separately reported small case–control series with increased prevalence of PFO in patients with cryptogenic stroke (CS).12 To date, these descriptive series have been followed only by additional case–control studies, without prospective collection of primary occurrence of CS + PFO in a well defined population. While these case–control series have significant limitations, meta-analysis by Overell and colleagues suggested a strong correlation between PFO and primary occurrence of CS.3 In this analysis, prevalence of CS + PFO in persons of all ages was three times greater (95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.0 to 4.3) than in non-stroke controls; this relation was even more compelling in persons with CS aged \&lt; 55 years of age, where PFO prevalence was five times greater (95\% CI 3.2 …},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterised by highly variable beat intervals. The aims of the study were to assess the accuracy of AF detection algorithms from short analysis durations and to validate prospectively the accuracy on a large community-based cohort of elderly subjects. Three algorithms for AF detection were evaluated: coefficient of variation (CV), mean successive difference (??) and coefficient of sample entropy (COSEn), using two databases of beat interval recordings: 167 recordings of 300. s duration for a range of rhythms acquired in a hospital setting and 2130 recordings of 10. s duration acquired in the community. Using the longer recordings receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to identify optimal algorithm thresholds and to evaluate analysis durations ranging from 5. s to 60. s. An ROC area of 93\% was obtained at recording duration of 60. s but remained above 90\% for durations as low as 5. s. Prospective analysis on the 2130 recordings gave AF detector sensitivities from 90.5\% (CV and ??) to 95.2\% (COSEn), specificities from 89.3\% (??) to 93.4\% (COSEn) and accuracy from 89.3\% (??) to 93.4\% (COSEn), not significantly different to those obtained on the initial database. AF detection algorithms are effective for short analysis durations, offering the prospect of a simple and rapid diagnostic test based on beat intervals alone. ?? 2012 IPEM.},

We reviewed 41 patients who underwent 46 LT reconstructions over the past 10 years. Success was judged by the ability to decannulate patients within 1 year postoperatively. Of our patients, 63\% were treated successfully, and an additional 17\% had intermediate success. The techniques used for laryngotracheoplasty with augmentation grafting and tracheal resection are reviewed. Major complications, thoracic complications, and wound complications are presented. Each patient was staged by the McCaffrey staging system and Cotton grades. We propose a new staging system based on the extent of the stenosis throughout the glottis, subglottis, and trachea. It is logical and easy to use. Applied to our cases of LT stenosis retrospectively, the new system predicts clinical success (chi2, p = .05). Using contingency tables and chi2 testing for statistical evaluation, we found that diabetics have a significantly higher failure rate (chi2, p = .0002). Further, we identified a group of patients who in addition to the airway stenosis also had comorbid medical conditions that frequently necessitate a tracheostomy. These patients have a significantly higher failure rate (chi2, p = .009). Using this information and applying the staging system prior to reconstruction, we can identify patients likely to fail.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy and effective service life of commercially available Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments with repetitive loading. METHODS: We obtained 6 brands of Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments (SWM) from commercial vendors identified from the Internet and the federal registry. Five monofilaments of each brand were subjected to repeat loading cycles, allowed to rest over night and loaded again the next day. First, sets of five monofilaments were loaded 25 times for each of five days. Then sets of five monofilaments were subjected to 200 loading cycles a day for 15 days. A testing jig ensured each SWM was loaded perpendicular to a digital pressure plate. The buckling force was measured via the pressure plate to determine failure loads. Several statistical techniques were used to examine the behavior of the monofilaments over repeated loadings: time series analysis, ANOVA and nonparametric comparisons of load distributions. RESULTS: The monofilaments tested were neither precise nor accurate. The plasticity of filaments increased with repeated loadings resulting in lower bending forces. Individual and average bending forces varied widely both within and between monofilament brands. All monofilaments showed a typical material failure pattern. Initially the bending force was high but rapidly decreased and then leveled out at levels 1-2g lower than the starting values. After resting over night, the initial bending force was again high but usually not as high as the previous day and bending forces decreased and then leveled out. Most monofilaments did not start at the accepted 10-g buckling force but varied by up to 30\% (p\textbackslash textless0.01). At best, monofilaments starting at the accepted 10±1g buckling force would remain within a usable range (9-11g) for 7-9 days or to evaluate 70-90 patients. CONCLUSION: Commercially available SWM have significant variability within and between devices from different manufacturers. Their actual bending force varies widely from their designated 10g value. When used they have a short service life where the instrument is within 10\% of their initial bending force which is not usually the stated 10g of force.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Despite several randomized trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have demonstrated the effectiveness of antimicrobial (triclosan-coated or -impregnated) sutures (TCS), the clinical and economic impact of using these sutures compared with conventional non-antimicrobial-coated absorbable sutures (NCS) remains poorly documented. Methods An independent systematic review and meta-analysis of all published evidence from January 2005 to September 2016 comparing TCS with NCS was conducted. Surgical-site infection (SSI) was the primary outcome. The results of the meta-analysis were used in a decision-tree deterministic and stochastic cost model, using the National Health Service (NHS England)-based cost of inpatient admissions for infections and differential costs of TCS versus NCS. Results Thirty-four studies were included in the final assessment from an initial 163 identified citations; 20 of 34 studies were randomized, and 17 of 34 reported blinding of physicians and assessors. Using a random-effects model, the odds ratio for SSI in the TCS compared with NCS control groups was statistically significant (odds ratio 0·61, 95 per cent c.i. 0·52 to 0·73; P {$<$} 0·001). There was significant heterogeneity (I2 = 49 per cent). Using random-effects event estimates of SSI for TCS and NCS for each individual wound type, the mean savings per surgical procedure from using antimicrobial sutures were significant: £91·25 (90 per cent c.i. 49·62 to 142·76) (?105·09 (57·15 to 164·41); exchange rate 15 November 2016) across all wound types. Conclusion The reviewed literature suggested that antimicrobial sutures may result in significant savings across various surgical wound types.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus is used for the treatment of patients with medically refractory essential tremor (ET). The authors evaluated patient outcomes after DBS surgery. METHODS: Clinical outcomes were evaluated in 19 patients who had undergone DBS surgery by using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale. All adverse outcomes were also systematically recorded during follow-up outpatient visits. Eighteen DBS systems were implanted. The median follow-up period after surgery was 27 months (range 10-75 months). The preoperative mean Fahn-Tolosa-Marin action tremor score was 3.3 +/- 0.5, and the postoperative mean score with the DBS system activated was 0.8 +/- 0.4. The mean preoperative writing score was 2.8 +/- 0.9, and the postoperative mean writing score with the DBS system activated was 1 +/- 0.6. (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p \textbackslash textless 0.005). Fourteen patients were treated with bipolar stimulation, and four eventually required monopolar stimulation. Complications included lead breakage (one patient); temporary erythema of the incision through which the pulse generator had been implanted, which required oral antibiotics (one patient); electrode migration, which required surgery (one patient); and mild hand tingling during stimulation (three patients). Twelve of 18 patients with implanted systems experienced no morbid condition. CONCLUSIONS: Thalamic DBS is safe and effective for medically refractory ET. Stimulator adjustments can frequently occur in some patients, and tremor may worsen despite a readjustment in the system.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects three to five million Americans and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Existing methods to diagnose this paroxysmal arrhythmia are cumbersome and/or expensive. We hypothesized that an iPhone 4S can be used to detect AF based on its ability to record a pulsatile photoplethysmogram signal from a fingertip using the built-in camera lens. To investigate the capability of the iPhone 4S for AF detection, we first used two databases, the MIT-BIH AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) to derive discriminatory threshold values between two rhythms. Both databases include RR time series originating from 250 Hz sampled ECG recordings. We rescaled the RR time series to 30 Hz so that the RR time series resolution is 1/30 (s) which is equivalent to the resolution from an iPhone 4S. We investigated three statistical methods consisting of the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), the Shannon entropy (ShE) and the sample entropy (SampE), which have been proved to be useful tools for AF assessment. Using 64-beat segments from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy value of 0.9405, 0.9300, and 0.9614 for RMSSD, ShE, and SampE, respectively. Using an iPhone 4S, we collected 2-min pulsatile time series from 25 prospectively recruited subjects with AF pre- and postelectrical cardioversion. Using derived threshold values of RMSSD, ShE and SampE from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy of 0.9844, 0.8494, and 0.9522, respectively. It should be recognized that for clinical applications, the most relevant objective is to detect the presence of AF in the data. Using this criterion, we achieved an accuracy of 100\% for both the MIT-BIH AF and iPhone 4S databases.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Total, viable and necrotic tumour tissue, tumour cell yields, and colony forming efficiencies were measured in clone A human colon tumour xenografts as neoplasms grew from about 100 mm3 to about 6000 mm3. The volumes of the total, viable and necrotic compartments were fit using the Verhulst equation to obtain estimates of growth rates and maximal sizes of the various compartments (carrying capacities). Additionally, at four discrete tumour volumes (250, 850, 2500 and 5500 mm3), hypoxic percentages, proportions of parenchymal tumour and host cells, interstitial fluid pressures, and proliferation kinetics including measurements of apoptosis were determined. There were interesting relationships between the shapes of the curves for total, viable and necrotic tissue to some of the other endpoints measured. Specifically, the volumetric growth curves for the total and viable tumour tissue compartments were identical to a volume of approximately 1000 mm3, but diverged at larger sizes, with the viable cell compartment exhibiting a smaller carrying capacity. The shape of the growth curve for the necrotic compartment exactly mimicked that for the total volume compartment, but was delayed in time by about 21 days. Similarity in shape to that of the overall tumour volume/necrotic volume curves was also seen for the curve for the increase in interstitial fluid pressure, and for the increase in the size of the host cell compartment. In contrast, the growth of the hypoxic compartment and of the parenchymal tumour cell compartment were similar in shape to that of the viable compartment. These data indicate that these compartments are functionally linked. Marked changes in cell kinetic parameters occurred as tumour size increased from 250?5500 mm3. The labelling index and growth fractions decreased from 0.256?0.125, and 0.77?0.40 respectively, and the cell loss factor increased from 0.52?0.74. The volumetric and potential doubling times increased from 4.3?17.6 and 2.1?4.6 days respectively. The cell kinetic changes could not be clearly related to the changes in shape of either the overall tumour volume or the viable tumour volume.},

  abstract = {The WHO/Rose Questionnaire on intermittent claudication was developed in 1962 for use in epidemiological surveys, and has been widely used. Several population studies have shown, however, that it is only moderately sensitive (60-68\%), although highly specific (90-100\%). In this study, reasons for the poor sensitivity and good specificity were determined following its application to 586 claudicants and to 61 subjects with other causes of leg pain. The results showed two important findings: firstly, that over half of the false negatives were produced by one question alone; and secondly that only three questions were required to maintain the specificity of the questionnaire. This knowledge, in conjunction with the pre-testing of additional questions, enabled a new questionnaire to be constructed: the "Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire". This questionnaire was tested on 300 subjects aged over 55 years attending their general practitioner, and found to be 91.3\% (95\% CI 88.1-94.5\%) sensitive and 99.3\% (95\% CI 98.9-100\%) specific in comparison to the diagnosis of intermittent claudication made by a physician. The repeatability of the questionnaire after 6 months was excellent (kappa = 0.76, p \textbackslash textless 0.001). These results suggest that this revised version of the WHO/Rose Questionnaire should be adopted for use in future epidemiological surveys of peripheral vascular disease.},

  abstract = {Intermittent claudication is associated with a poor prognosis, but less is known of the risks associated with asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence and natural history of claudication, and the incidence of cardiovascular events in symptomatic and asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease.In 1988, 1592 subjects aged 55–74 years were selected randomly from the age-sex registers of 10 general practices in Edinburgh, Scotland. The presence of peripheral arterial disease was determined by the World Health Organization questionnaire on Intermittent claudication, the ankle brachial pressure Index and a reactive hyperaemia test. This cohort was followed prospectively over 5 years for subsequent cardiovascular events and death.One hundred and sixteen new cases of claudication were identified (incidence density 15.5 per 1000 person-years). Of those with claudication at baseline, 28.8\% still had pain after 5 years, 8.2\% underwent vascular surgery or amputation, and 1.4\% developed leg ulceration. Claudicants had a significantly increased risk of developing angina compared with normals (RR: 2.31, 95\% Cl: 1.04–5.10), and asymptomatic subjects had a slightly Increased risk of myo-cardial infarction and stroke. Deaths from cardiovascular disease were more likely in both claudicants (RR: 2.67, 95\% Cl: 1.34–5.29) and subjects with major (RR: 2.08, 95\% CI: 1.13–3.83) or minor asymptomatic disease (RR: 1.74, 95\% Cl: 1.09–2.76). Subjects with major asymptomatic disease also had an increased risk of non-cardiovascular death (RR: 2.19, 95\% Cl: 1.33–3.59), and therefore had the highest overall risk of death (RR: 2.44, 95\% Cl: 1.59–3.74).Subjects with asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease appear to have the same increased risk of cardiovascular events and death found In claudicants.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To propose standardized consensus definitions for important clinical endpoints in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), investigations in an effort to improve the quality of clinical research and to enable meaningful comparisons between clinical trials. To make these consensus definitions accessible to all stakeholders in TAVI clinical research through a peer reviewed publication, on behalf of the public health. BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation may provide a worthwhile less invasive treatment in many patients with severe aortic stenosis and since its introduction to the medical community in 2002, there has been an explosive growth in procedures. The integration of TAVI into daily clinical practice should be guided by academic activities, which requires a harmonized and structured process for data collection, interpretation, and reporting during well-conducted clinical trials. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Valve Academic Research Consortium established an independent collaboration between Academic Research organizations and specialty societies (cardiology and cardiac surgery) in the USA and Europe. Two meetings, in San Francisco, California (September 2009) and in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (December 2009), including key physician experts, and representatives from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and device manufacturers, were focused on creating consistent endpoint definitions and consensus recommendations for implementation in TAVI clinical research programs. Important considerations in developing endpoint definitions included (i) respect for the historical legacy of surgical valve guidelines; (ii) identification of pathophysiological mechanisms associated with clinical events; (iii) emphasis on clinical relevance. Consensus criteria were developed for the following endpoints: mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding, acute kidney injury, vascular complications, and prosthetic valve performance. Composite endpoints for TAVI safety and effectiveness were also recommended. CONCLUSION: Although consensus criteria will invariably include certain arbitrary features, an organized multidisciplinary process to develop specific definitions for TAVI clinical research should provide consistency across studies that can facilitate the evaluation of this new important catheter-based therapy. The broadly based consensus endpoint definitions described in this document may be useful for regulatory and clinical trial purposes.},

  abstract = {Background: Serum creatinine concentration is widely used as an index of renal function, but this concentration is affected by factors other than glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Objective: To develop an equation to predict GFR from serum creatinine concentration and other factors. Design: Cross-sectional study of GFR, creatinine clearance, serum creatinine concentration, and demographic and clinical characteristics in patients with chronic renal disease. Patients: 1628 patients enrolled in the baseline period of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study, of whom 1070 were randomly selected as the training sample; the remaining 558 patients constituted the validation sample. Methods: The prediction equation was developed by stepwise regression applied to the training sample. The equation was then tested and compared with other prediction equations in the validation sample. Results: To simplify prediction of GFR, the equation included only demographic and serum variables. Independent factors associated with a lower GFR included a higher serum creatinine concentration, older age, female sex, nonblack ethnicity, higher serum urea nitrogen levels, and lower serum albumin levels (P~{$<~$}0.001 for all factors). The multiple regression model explained 90.3\% of the variance in the logarithm of GFR in the validation sample. Measured creatinine clearance overestimated GFR by 19\%, and creatinine clearance predicted by the Cockcroft-Gault formula overestimated GFR by 16\%. After adjustment for this overestimation, the percentage of variance of the logarithm of GFR predicted by measured creatinine clearance or the Cockcroft-Gault formula was 86.6\% and 84.2\%, respectively. Conclusion: The equation developed from the MDRD Study provided a more accurate estimate of GFR in our study group than measured creatinine clearance or other commonly used equations. *For members of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group, see N Engl J Med. 1994; 330:877-84.},

The 4-variable equation from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study has been reexpressed for use with a standardized assay. Objective: To describe the performance of the revised 4-variable MDRD Study equation and compare it with the performance of the 6-variable MDRD Study and Cockcroft?Gault equations. Design: Comparison of estimated and measured GFR. Setting: 15 clinical centers participating in a randomized, controlled trial. Patients: 1628 patients with chronic kidney disease participating in the MDRD Study. Measurements: Serum creatinine levels were calibrated to an assay traceable to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. Glomerular filtration rate was measured as urinary clearance of 125I-iothalamate. Results: Mean measured GFR was 39.8 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (SD, 21.2). Accuracy and precision of the revised 4-variable equation were similar to those of the original 6-variable equation and better than in the Cockcroft?Gault equation, even when the latter was corrected for bias, with 90\%, 91\%, 60\%, and 83\% of estimates within 30\% of measured GFR, respectively. Differences between measured and estimated GFR were greater for all equations when the estimated GFR was 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or greater. Limitations: The MDRD Study included few patients with a GFR greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Equations were not compared in a separate study sample. Conclusions: The 4-variable MDRD Study equation provides reasonably accurate GFR estimates in patients with chronic kidney disease and a measured GFR of less than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2. By using the reexpressed MDRD Study equation with the standardized serum creatinine assay, clinical laboratories can report more accurate GFR estimates. *For a list of investigators of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, see the Appendix.},

  abstract = {In this work, we describe a beat-by-beat method for assessing the clinical utility of pulsatile waveforms, primarily recorded from cardiovascular blood volume or pressure changes, concentrating on the photoplethysmogram (PPG). Physiological blood flow is nonstationary, with pulses changing in height, width and morphology due to changes in heart rate, cardiac output, sensor type and hardware or software pre-processing requirements. Moreover, considerable inter-individual and sensor-location variability exists. Simple template matching methods are therefore inappropriate, and a patient-specific adaptive initialization is therefore required. We introduce dynamic time warping to stretch each beat to match a running template and combine it with several other features related to signal quality, including correlation and the percentage of the beat that appeared to be clipped. The features were then presented to a multi-layer perceptron neural network to learn the relationships between the parameters in the presence of good- and bad-quality pulses. An expert-labeled database of 1055 segments of PPG, each 6 s long, recorded from 104 separate critical care admissions during both normal and verified arrhythmic events, was used to train and test our algorithms. An accuracy of 97.5\% on the training set and 95.2\% on test set was found. The algorithm could be deployed as a stand-alone signal quality assessment algorithm for vetting the clinical utility of PPG traces or any similar quasi-periodic signal.},

In this paper the exact (1 - alpha) confidence limits, RL and RU, have been simplified, and a new exact test of the null hypothesis that R = 1 has been derived. The exact methods depend on the F distribution; they are simple to calculate and all have been fully validated. Even after simplification, methods for obtaining approximations to RL and RU remain more unwieldy than the exact methods, and an evaluation shows that these approximations may occasionally be far from the truth. It is argued that there is no excuse for not using the exact methods.},

  abstract = {Many disease diagnoses involve subjective judgments by qualified raters. For example, through the inspection of a mammogram, MRI, or ultrasound image, the clinician himself becomes part of the measuring instrument. To reduce diagnostic errors and improve the quality of diagnoses, it is necessary to assess raters' diagnostic skills and to improve their skills over time. This paper focuses on a subjective binary classification process, proposing a hierarchical model linking data on rater opinions with patient true disease-development outcomes. The model allows for the quantification of the effects of rater diagnostic skills (bias and magnifier) and patient latent disease severity on the rating results. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed to estimate these parameters. Linking to patient true disease outcomes, the rater-specific sensitivity and specificity can be estimated using MCMC samples. Cost theory is used to identify poor- and strong-performing raters and to guide adjustment of rater bias and diagnostic magnifier to improve the rating performance. Furthermore, diagnostic magnifier is shown as a key parameter to present a rater's diagnostic ability because a rater with a larger diagnostic magnifier has a uniformly better receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve when varying the value of diagnostic bias. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the proposed methods, and the methods are illustrated with a mammography example.},

  abstract = {The incidence rate of laryngeal papillomas in a Danish subpopulation (approximately 2.8 million inhabitants) was 3.84 x 10(-6) per year in the period 1968-1984. For juvenile papillomas the incidence rate was 3.62 x 10(-6), compared with 3.94 x 10(-6) for laryngeal papillomas of adult onset. When comparing different time periods a significantly low incidence was found in the time 1965-1968, while the incidence remained constant in 1969-1984. The low incidence rate in the early period may be real, but selectional bias may have played a part. It is general anticipated that maternal genital HPV-infections may serve as an HPV-reservoir, and that juvenile laryngeal papillomas is a result of HPV transmission from the mother to the child during birth. In the period in question cervical HPV-infections have been recorded with increasing frequency in younger women, indicating that the prevalence is rising. However, this is not reflected in the incidence of laryngeal papillomas.},

  abstract = {Objective: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) emerged as a direct clinical spin-off from the Gate Control Theory from 1965. Over the last decade, several new modes of SCS have appeared. This review discusses these novel techniques and their hypothetical mechanisms of action. Material and Methods: A recent literature search on SCS coupled with the most recent data from poster presentations and congress lectures have been used to illustrate new hypothetical ways of modulating pain. Results: Several physiological and neurochemical mechanisms for conventional paresthetic SCS have been described in detail. However, much less is known about the novel SCS modes of action. One new algorithm utilizes very high frequencies (up to 10 kHz) intended for direct stimulation of dorsal horns at the T9-T10 level to treat both low back pain and leg pain. Another technique uses bursts of impulses with a high internal frequency delivered to the dorsal spinal cord with a frequency of 40 Hz. Both of these therapies intend to be subparesthetic and effective both for neuropathic and nociceptive pain components. During the last few years, more moderate changes in SCS parameters have been tried in order to increase the amount of electric charge passed from the lead to the neural tissue. This strategy, called "high density SCS," utilizes frequencies up to 1200 Hz or long pulse widths. Conclusions: The present SCS therapies have developed beyond the Gate Control Concept. New hypotheses about mechanisms of action are presented and some improved results are discussed.Copyright © 2017 International Neuromodulation Society.},

Such a model could help researchers and clinicians to evaluate therapies, improve the design of prospective studies, monitor practice patterns, counsel individual patients, and determine the best candidates for lung transplantation. The authors used information from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR), which has collected longitudinal data on approximately 90\% of cystic fibrosis patients diagnosed in the United States since 1986. They developed multivariate logistic regression models by using data on 5,820 patients randomly selected from 11,630 in the CFFPR in 1993. Models were tested for goodness of fit and were validated for the remaining 5,810 patients for 1993. The validated 5-year survivorship model included age, forced expiratory volume in 1 second as a percentage of predicted normal, gender, weight-for-age z score, pancreatic sufficiency, diabetes mellitus, Staphylococcus aureus infection, Burkerholderia cepacia infection, and annual number of acute pulmonary exacerbations. The model provides insights into the complex nature of cystic fibrosis and supplies a rigorous tool for clinical practice and research.},

The most commonly used schema is the Cardiac failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke [Doubled] (CHADS(2)) score. Although simple and well validated, some limitations of CHADS(2) this schema are apparent. A more recent approach to risk stratification of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation defines "major (definitive)" risk factors (eg, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack and age\textbackslash textgreater or =75 years) and "clinically relevant non-major" risk factors (eg, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, female gender, age 65-75 years, and atherosclerotic vascular disease). This scheme can be expressed as an acronym, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc, denoting Cardiac failure or dysfunction, Hypertension, Age\textbackslash textgreater or =75 [Doubled], Diabetes, Stroke [Doubled]-Vascular disease, Age 65-74, and Sex category [Female]), whereby 2 points are assigned for a history of stroke or age 75 years or more and 1 point each is assigned for age 65 to 74 years, a history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiac failure, and vascular disease. Patients with 1 definitive risk factor or a patient with a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 1 or more could be considered for oral anticoagulation, but a patient with a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 0 is truly low risk and could be managed with no antithrombotic therapy. This would simplify our approach to thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation.},

  abstract = {Introduction In the UK, primary care is seen as the optimal context for delivering care to an ageing population with a growing number of long-term conditions. However, if it is to meet these demands effectively and efficiently, a more precise understanding of existing care processes is required to ensure their configuration is based on robust evidence. This need to understand and optimise organisational performance is not unique to healthcare, and in industries such as telecommunications or finance, a methodology known as process mining has become an established and successful method to identify how an organisation can best deploy resources to meet the needs of its clients and customers. Here and for the first time in the UK, we will apply it to primary care settings to gain a greater understanding of how patients with two of the most common chronic conditions are managed.Methods and analysis The study will be conducted in three phases; first, we will apply process mining algorithms to the data held on the clinical management system of four practices of varying characteristics in the West Midlands to determine how each interacts with patients with hypertension or type 2 diabetes. Second, we will use traditional process mapping exercises at each practice to manually produce maps of care processes for the selected condition. Third, with the aid of staff and patients at each practice, we will compare and contrast the process models produced by process mining with the process maps produced via manual techniques, review differences and similarities between them and the relative importance of each. The first pilot study will be on hypertension and the second for patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been provided by East Midlands–Leicester South Regional Ethics Committee (REC reference 18/EM/0284). Having refined the automated production of maps of care processes, we can explore pinch points and bottlenecks, process variants and unexpected behaviour, and make informed recommendations to improve the quality and efficiency of care. The results of this study will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.},

Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the differences in PTT when cuff pressure (P(cuff)) was raised or deflated to the desired level. Sixteen subjects participated in this study and according to their systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBF), 8 levels of P(cuff) were predetermined for them individually. P(cuff) was directly raised to each predetermined level while 20 seconds of electrocardiographic and photoplethysmographic signals were recorded for the calculation of PTT. Another set of recordings were taken when P(cuff) was raised above the SBP and deflated to the predetermined levels. The results of this study showed that PTT increase significantly when P(cuff) was larger than 80\% of DBF, regardless of whether P(cuff) was reached by inflation or deflation. Overall, no significant difference was found between PTT obtained during inflation and deflation for 12 out of the 16 subjects. To conclude, changes in PTT are mainly induced by the level of cuff pressure when there is no prolonged period of artery occlusion.},

  abstract = {Non-invasive monitoring of fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) plays an important role in detecting and diagnosing fetal diseases. This study aimed to develop a multi-step method for locating both maternal and fetal QRS complexes from abdominal ECG (aECG) recordings. The proposed method included four major steps: abdominal ECG pre-processing, maternal QRS complex locating, maternal ECG cancellation and fetal QRS complex locating. Signal quality assessment (SQA) and fine-tuning for maternal ECG (FTM) were implemented in the first and third steps, respectively. The method was then evaluated using 75 non-invasive 4-channel aECG recordings provided by the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013. The F1 measure, which is a new index introduced by Behar et al (2013 Proc. Comput. Cardiol. 40 297-300), was used to assess the locating accuracy. The other two indices, mean squared error of heart rate (MSE\_HR) between the fetal HR signals estimated from the reference and our method (MSE\_HR in bpm(2)) and root mean squared difference between the corresponding fetal RR intervals (MSE\_RR in ms) were also used to assess the locating accuracy. Overall, for the maternal QRS complex, the F1 measure was 98.4\% from the method without the implementation of SQA, and it was improved to 99.8\% with SQA. For the fetal QRS complex, the F1 measure, MSE\_HR and MSE\_RR were 84.9\%, 185.6 bpm(2) and 19.4 ms for the method without both SQA and FTM procedures. They were improved to 93.9\%, 47.5 bpm(2) and 7.6 ms with both SQA and FTM procedures. These improvements were observed from each individual subject. It can be concluded that implementing both SQA and FTM procedures could achieve better performance for locating both maternal and fetal QRS complexes.},

  abstract = {Background:  Laparoscopic colorectal surgery may adversely affect respiration, circulation, and acid-base balance in elderly patients, owing to the relatively long duration of CO2 absorption. We conducted this retrospective study to determine the safety and efficacy of warmed, humidified CO2 pneumoperitoneum in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Methods: We enrolled 245 patients between January 2016 and August 2018. The experimental group (warming and humidification group [WH]) received warmed (37°C), humidified (98\%) insufflation of CO2, and the control group (cold, dry CO2/control group [CD]) received standard CO2 (19°C, 0\%). All other aspects of patient care were standardized. Intraoperative hemodynamic data, arterial blood pH, and lactic acid levels were recorded. We also recorded intra-abdominal pressure, incidence of shivering 1{$\mkern1mu$}hour after surgery, satisfaction scores of patients and surgeons 24{$\mkern1mu$}hours after surgery, times to first flatus/defecation, first bowel movement, and tolerance of semiliquid food, discharge time, and incidence of vomiting, diarrhea, and surgical site infections. Results: Compared with the WH group, heart rate and mean arterial pressure were significantly higher from T3 to T8 (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05), lactic acid levels were significantly higher from T4 to T9 (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05), and recovery time in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) was significantly longer in the CD group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05). Patient and surgeon satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the WH group than the CD group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05). In addition, the times to first flatus/defecation and bowel movement were significantly longer in the CD group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05). No significant differences were noted between the groups in the time to tolerance of semiliquid food and time of discharge (P{$\mkern1mu>\mkern1mu$}.05). The incidence of vomiting, diarrhea, and shivering was significantly lower in the WH group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05). The number of patients with a shivering grade of 0 was significantly higher in the WH group, whereas the number with a shivering grade of 3 was significantly higher in the CD group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05). Conclusion: Warmed, humidified insufflation of CO2 in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery could stabilize hemodynamics, and reduce lactic acid levels, recovery time in the PACU, and the incidence of acute gastrointestinal injury-related symptoms.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cause of stroke and a marker of atherosclerosis and of all patients with stroke, around 17\% have AF. The screening and treatment of AF could prevent about 12\% of all strokes. Several relatively low-cost devices with good accuracy now exist which can detect AF including WatchBP and AliveCor. However, they can only measure the ECG or pulse over short time periods. Inexpensive devices such as heart rate monitors, which are widely available, can measure heart rate for prolonged periods and may have potential in screening for AF. This study aims to determine the accuracy of AliveCor and WatchBP along with a bespoke algorithm using a heart rate monitor belt (Polar H7) and a wearable RR interval recorder (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2) for detecting AF during a single screening visit in primary care patients. METHODS/ANALYSIS A multicentre case-control diagnostic study comparing the four different devices for the detection of AF with a reference standard consisting of a 12-lead ECG in GP surgeries across Hampshire, UK. We aim to recruit 92 participants with AF and 329 without AF aged 65 years and over. We will ask participants to rate comfort and overall impression for each device. We will collect qualitative data from participants capturing their experience of using wearable devices in order to evaluate acceptability. We will collect data from GPs to determine their views on AF screening. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This protocol was approved by the London-City \& East Research Ethics Committee in June 2016. The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference presentations and the Atrial Fibrillation Association, UK.

  abstract = {Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy is commonly prescribed for longstanding, acute cases of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) during which patients must wear a tight-fitting breathing mask overnight for the duration of the treatment. Because this condition frequently leads to the permanent use of CPAP masks, interface selection is a crucial factor influencing the treatment quality and effectiveness. Masks/interface selection is normally performed on a trial an error basis with clinicians informing their selection based on OSA-related factors with basic fitting feedback from patients. However, it is not uncommon for patients to abandon the treatment or request additional consultations due to ill-fitting CPAP mask with the main sources of discomfort being perceived air leakage and mask/strap overtightening leading to skin damage. This work introduces a novel system (Smart-Fit), for CPAP interface selection using advanced digital technologies, such as Reverse Engineering and Computational Modeling (Finite Element Analysis) which are paired to evaluate and determine the best fitting interface for each clinical case. The model simplifies the number of 3D facial landmarks to 12 and established that a 2?mm scan resolution is enough for accurate scans. The Von Mises stress map in ANSYS serves as an indicator of potential high-pressure areas, triggering the need for a chance of mask size. Current results indicate the Smart Fit System can enable a ?best fit CPAP interface? to be selected considering individual?s physical characteristics and existing CPAP interface configurations. The development of the Smart Fit System is an evolution compared to traditional CPAP interface selection approach, which optimizes the CPAP interface selection process.}

It occurs in around one-third of patients treated in intensive care unit (ICU) and is even more prevalent in cardiac surgery patients. There is a higher mortality in patients with AKI compared with non-AKI counterparts, and in severe AKI requiring renal support, the 6 month mortality is \textbackslash textgreater50\%. Unlike the progressive development of biomarkers in cardiology, there have been few changes in kidney diagnostic markers. Creatinine is still used as an indicator of kidney function but not of the parenchymal kidney injury. Serum creatinine (sCr) concentration does not change until around 50\% of kidney function is lost, and varies with muscle mass, age, sex, medications, and hydration status. The lag time between injury and loss of function, risks missing a therapeutic opportunity, and may explain the high associated mortality. Novel biomarkers of AKI- and failure include neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-18, and cystatin C. The pathophysiology associated with accumulation of these markers in plasma and urine is not clear, but a common denominator is inflammation. Some of these new AKI biomarkers may have clinical applicability in anaesthesia and intensive care in the future. It is possible that a 'kidney biomarker panel' will become standard before and after major surgery. If elevated or positive, the anaesthetist must take special care to optimize the patients after operation on the surgical wards or ICU to avoid further nephrotoxic insults and initiate supplementary care.},

  abstract = {Objective: People with diabetic neuropathy who have previously ulcerated are at high risk of re-ulceration. They should regularly attend podiatry clinics for surveillance and routine protective podiatric treatment. It has been suggested that inflammation prior to skin breakdown shows up as a hotspot on a thermal image even in the absence of clinical signs. The aim of this study is to quantify inter-patient and intra-patient thermal variations presented by diabetic feet at high risk of ulceration. Approach: Whole foot and spot temperatures were recorded for 96 patients who attended two successive podiatry appointments without ulceration 28 [28, 31] days apart, median [interquartile range]. This was a part of a longer study into whether thermal imaging in clinic can reduce the rate of re-ulceration. Main results: The variation in spot temperature right/left differences for single patients between visits was comparable to the variation observed between patients (0.8 [0.3, 1.5] °C compared with 0.9 [0.4, 1.7] °C). Similarly, whole foot temperature variation for a single patient between visits was comparable to the variation observed between patients (0.6 [0.2, 1.1] °C compared with 0.8 [0.2, 1.3] °C). Significance: Thresholds which depend on thermal differences from visit to visit are unlikely to have sufficient specificity to effectively target treatment designed to prevent the development of foot ulcers.},

There was no sex-related difference, and the association with age was weak. In a study of variability [by the method of Fraser and Harris (Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci 1989;27:409-37)], the analytical variability was 5.2\%; the within-subject variability, CVI, was 42.2\%; and the between-subject variability, CVG, was 92.5\%. The critical difference for sequential values significant at P [\textbackslash textless=]0.05 (i.e., the smallest percentage change unlikely to be due to analytical variability or CVI) was calculated as 118\%, and the index of individuality, CVI/CVG, was 0.46. This suggests that CRP, like many clinical chemistry analytes, has limited usefulness in detecting early disease-associated changes when used in conjunction with a healthy reference interval. From a molecular epidemiological standpoint, the usefulness of CRP in longitudinal studies is suggested by the small index of individuality and by observations that (a) short-term fluctuations were infrequent, (b) all data stayed within the reference interval, and (c) relative rankings of the subjects over 6 months only moderately deteriorated.},

These disorders present major challenges to healthcare providers, as few effective medical therapies are currently available. Recently, there has been increasing interest in dietary therapies for IBS, particularly a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). Since ingestion of FODMAPs increases the delivery of readily fermentable substrates and water to the distal small intestine and colon-which results in luminal distention and gas-the reduction of FODMAPs in a patient's diet may improve functional gastrointestinal symptoms. This paper will review the pathophysiology of IBS and the role of FODMAPs for the treatment of this condition.},

  abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this article is to report early and mid-term outcomes of the ACCESS-EU study (ACCESS-Europe A Two-Phase Observational Study of the MitraClip System in Europe), a European prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized post-approval study of MitraClip therapy (Abbott Vascular, Inc., Santa Clara, California). Background MitraClip has been increasingly performed in Europe after approval; the ACCESS-EU registry provides a snapshot of the real-world clinical demographic data and outcomes. Methods A total of 567 patients with significant mitral valve regurgitation (MR) underwent MitraClip therapy at 14 European sites. Mean logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation at baseline was 23.0 ± 18.3; 84.9\% patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, and 52.7\% of patients had an ejection fraction~≤40\%. Results The MitraClip implant rate was 99.6\%. A total of 19 patients (3.4\%) died within 30 days after the MitraClip procedure. The Kaplan-Meier survival at 1 year was 81.8\%. Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay was 2.5~±~6.5 days and 7.7 ± 8.2 days, respectively. Single leaflet device attachment was reported in 27 patients (4.8\%). There were no MitraClip device embolizations. Thirty-six subjects (6.3\%) required mitral valve surgery within 12 months after the MitraClip implant procedure. There was improvement in the severity of MR at 12 months, compared with baseline (p~{$<$} 0.0001), with 78.9\% of patients free from MR, severity of {$>$}2+ at 12 months. At~12~months, 71.4\% of patients had New York Heart Association functional class II or class I. Six-min-walk-test improved 59.5 ± 112.4 m, and Minnesota-living-with-heart-failure score improved 13.5 ± 20.5 points. Conclusions In the real-world, post-approval experience in Europe, patients undergoing the MitraClip therapy are high-risk, elderly patients, mainly affected by functional MR. In this patient population, the MitraClip procedure is effective with low rates of hospital mortality and adverse events.},

  abstract = {Ten ways to improve information technology in the NHSI have a request for Richard Granger, the newly appointed director general of NHS Information Technology,1 who is responsible for implementing the government's ambitious and very costly plans for the use of information technology in the NHS.2 My request to Mr Granger is this: please can you implement an information technology programme that supports me in my clinical practice, helps to improve the quality of care I provide, and allows me to run my general practice more efficiently. To help Mr Granger to achieve this objective, I have listed the top 10 improvements I would like to see in the NHS information technology systems that I use.The list is based on my experience as a general practitioner, an academic, and someone with a reasonably good knowledge of information technology issues, as well as discussions with colleagues with varying levels of knowledge about information technology. I work in a practice that uses computers rather than paper medical records to document consultations and that has tried since 1999 to store all the information we receive on patients electronically.3 So I have direct experience of trying to use the outputs of the NHS information technology strategy in my day to day clinical work, as well as in my academic work.4 I realise that some other clinicians and managers may not agree with my list, but it does serve as a starting point for a debate on the direction that the NHS information technology strategy should take.5Summary pointsOver the next few years, the government proposes to spend several billion pounds on information technology developments in the NHS in EnglandThis programme is to be overseen by a newly appointed director general of NHS information technology, Richard GrangerThe NHS information technology strategy should be aimed at supporting clinicians …},

The authors hypothesized that episodic monoplane TEE with a limited examination would help guide the postoperative management of high-risk cardiac surgery patients. DESIGN: The authors analyzed the initial consecutive observational experience with the miniaturized transesophageal echocardiography monitoring system (ClariTEE, ImaCor, Uniondale, New York). SETTING: Single institution in a university setting. PARTICIPANTS: Unstable cardiac surgery patients. INTERVENTIONS: The authors assessed fluid responsiveness, echocardiographic data, and concordance among hemodynamic data. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From June 2010 to February 2011, 21 unstable cardiac surgery patients with postoperative instability were identified. Two patients (10\%) required reoperation for bleeding and tamponade physiology. Right ventricular dysfunction was diagnosed by episodic TEE monitoring in 7 patients (33\%), while hypovolemia was documented in 12 patients (57\%). Volume responsiveness was documented in 11 patients. In this observational study, discordance between hemodynamic monitoring and episodic TEE was qualitatively observed in 14 patients (66\%). CONCLUSION: The authors demonstrated the ability of episodic monoplane TEE to identify discordance between hemodynamic monitoring to better define clinical scenarios in unstable cardiac surgery patients. For these challenging patients, limited episodic TEE assessment has become a cornerstone of ICU care in this institution.},

Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a validated questionnaire on intermittent claudication for peripheral arterial disease in a clinical setting. Methods: We administered the Edinburgh questionnaire on intermittent claudication and measured ABI using a portable Doppler in 456 outpatients with type 2 diabetes. Subjects with intermittent claudication and an ABI above 0.9 were examined with color Doppler ultrasound imaging. Peripheral arterial disease was considered to be present when the ABI was {$<$}0.9 or the color Doppler arterial waveform was monophasic. Results: Thirty-five (7.6\%) of the 456 patients had intermittent claudication. Of these, 22 (63\%) had an ABI {$<$}0.9 and the remaining 13 (37\%) had an ABI {$>$}0.9. Of these latter, 12 were reexamined and 3 (25\%) were found to have monophasic waveforms in color Doppler, thus being diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease. The overall accuracy of intermittent claudication for peripheral arterial disease was 75\% (95\% CI, 71-79). Conclusion: Among patients with type 2 diabetes, a normal ABI does not rule out peripheral arterial disease; the use of an intermittent claudication questionnaire is able to identify correctly the disease in 3 out of 4 patients with diabetes. Our results suggest incorporating the intermittent claudication questionnaire into the general consultation instead of the general screening of the ABI.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The regulation of surgical implants is vital to patient safety, and there is an international drive to establish registries for all implants. Hearing loss is an area of unmet need, and industry is targeting this field with a growing range of surgically implanted hearing devices. Currently, there is no comprehensive UK registry capturing data on these devices; in its absence, it is difficult to monitor safety, practices and effectiveness. A solution is developing a national registry of all auditory implants. However, developing and maintaining a registry faces considerable challenges. In this systematic review, we aimed to identify the essential features of a successful surgical registry. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis recommendations. A comprehensive search of the Medline and Embase databases was conducted in November 2016 using the Ovid Portal. Inclusion criteria were: publications describing the design, development, critical analysis or current status of a national surgical registry. All registry names identified in the screening process were noted and searched in the grey literature. Available national registry reports were reviewed from registry websites. Data were extracted using a data extraction table developed by thematic analysis. Extracted data were synthesised into a structured narrative. RESULTS Sixty-nine publications were included. The fundamentals to successful registry development include: steering committee to lead and oversee the registry; clear registry objectives; planning for initial and long-term funding; strategic national collaborations among key stakeholders; dedicated registry management team; consensus meetings to agree registry dataset; established data processing systems; anticipating challenges; and implementing strategies to increase data completion. Patient involvement and awareness of legal factors should occur throughout the development process. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review provides robust knowledge that can be used to inform the successful development of any UK surgical registry. It also provides a methodological framework for international surgical registry development.},

The central hypotheses are that GIS generation depends on the motility patterns and the mechanical properties of the gut, and that changes in those result in measurable differences in GIS. An animal model which included both healthy rats and those with small bowel obstruction (SBO) was developed. The acoustic bursts, of GIS were detected by amplitude thresholding the signal envelope. Three methods of envelope estimation were proposed and evaluated. Envelope estimation using a Hilbert transform was found to produce the best results in the current application. The duration and dominant frequency of each detected GIS event was estimated and clear differences between healthy and diseased rats were discovered. In the control state, GIS events were found to consistently be of relatively short duration (3–65ms). Although the majority of events in the SBO state had similar short duration, infrequent longer events were also detected and appeared to be pathognomonic. Long duration events ({$>$}100 ms) occurred in each of seven obstructed, but in none of 14 non-obstructed, cases (p{$<$}0.001). It is concluded that GIS analysis may prove useful in the non-invasive, rapid, and accurate diagnosis of SBO.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Self-monitoring home blood pressure (BP) devices are currently recommended for long-term follow-up of hypertension and its management. Some of these devices are integrated with algorithms aimed at detecting atrial fibrillation (AF), which is common essential hypertension. This study was designed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of two widely diffused home BP monitoring devices in detecting AF in an unselected population of outpatients referred to a hypertension clinic because of high BP. METHODS: In 503 consecutive patients the authors simultaneously compared the accuracy of the Microlife(®) BP A200 Plus (Microlife) and the OMRON(®) M6 (OMRON) home BP devices, in detecting AF. RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic BP as well as heart rate (HR) values detected by the two devices were not significantly different. Pulse irregularity was detected in 124 and 112 patients with the OMRON M6 and Microlife BP A200 Plus devices, respectively. Simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) recording revealed that pulse irregularity was due to AF in 101 patients. Pulse irregularity detected by the OMRON M6 device corresponded to AF in 101, to supraventricular premature beats in 18, and to frequent premature ventricular beat in five patients, respectively. Pulse irregularity detected by the Microlife BP A200 Plus device corresponded to AF in 93, to supraventricular premature beats in 14, and to ventricular premature beats in five patients. The sensitivity for detecting AF was 100\%, the specificity was 92\%, and diagnostic accuracy 95\% for the OMRON M6 and 100\%, 92\%, and 95 for the Microlife BP A200 Plus, respectively. AF was newly diagnosed by ECG recordings in 47 patients, and was detected in all patients by the OMRON device, and in 42 patients by the Microlife device. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that OMRON M6 is more accurate than Microlife BP A200 Plus in detecting AF in patients with essential hypertension. Widespread use of these devices in hypertensive patients could be of clinical benefit for the early diagnosis and treatment of this arrhythmia and related consequences.},

Early diagnosis of valve disease is essential as delay can limit treatment and negatively affect prognosis for undiagnosed patients. The prevalence of unsuspected valve disease in the community is uncertain.Participants We prospectively evaluated 79\hspace{0.25em}043 patients, between 2001 and 2011, who were referred to a community open access echocardiography service for suspected heart failure. All patients underwent a standard transthoracic echocardiogram according to British Society of Echocardiography guidelines.Findings to date Of the total number, 29\hspace{0.25em}682 patients (37.5\%) were diagnosed with mild valve disease, 8983 patients (11.3\%) had moderate valve disease and 2134 (2.7\%) had severe valve disease. Of the total number of patients scanned, the prevalence of aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation was 10\%, 8.4\%, 1\%, and 12.5\% respectively. 18\% had tricuspid regurgitation. 5\% had disease involving one or more valves.Conclusions Of patients with suspected heart failure in the primary care setting, a significant proportion have important valvular heart disease. These patients are at high risk of future cardiac events and will require onward referral for further evaluation. We recommend that readily available community echocardiography services should be provided for general practitioners as this will result in early detection of valve disease.},

A measurement of blood pressure is an estimate of the true mean blood pressure. Clinical decisions are based on the average of several measurements. However, measurement is imperfect, and blood pressure shows random biological variation from beat to beat. Because of this unavoidable variation patients may be misclassified as above or below the treatment threshold. Thus, like any diagnostic or screening test, estimation of blood pressure is subject to false positives and false negatives. The proportion of test positives that are true positives is the positive predictive value of a test: an index of the test's precision.

The speed of sound c in the mixture should be known, preferably with an accuracy of ±0.1\% where clinical measurements to ±1\% are required. This article describes measurements of c in several ethanol/water mixtures over a range of temperatures using a simple pulse superposition technique, which gives an estimated measurement uncertainty of 0.1\%. The measurements show that, at 20°C, a mixture of 9.5 ± 0.25\% ethanol by volume in distilled water is required to give a speed of 1540 ± 1.5 m s−1. However, to achieve this accuracy, the temperature of the mixture must be maintained in the range 20° ± 0.75°C. (E-mail: kmartin@lri.org.uk)},

  abstract = {Abstract. We wished to determine the applicability of previously proposed deterministic mathematical models to description of growth of multicellular tumour spheroids. The models were placed into three general classes: empirical, functional and structural. From these classes, 17 models were applied systematically to growth curves of multicellular tumour spheroids used as paradigms of prevascular and microregional tumour growth. The spheroid growth curves were determined with uniquely high density of m'easurements and high precision. The theoretical growth curves obtained from the models were fitted by the weighted least-squares method to the 15 measured growth curves, each corresponding to a different cell line. The classical growth models such as von Berta-lanffy, logistic and Gompertz were considered as nested within more general models. Our results demonstrate that most models fitted the data fairly well and that criteria other than statistical had to be used for final selection. The Gompertz, the autostim-ulation and the simple spheroid models were the most appropriate for spheroid growth in the empirical, functional and structural classes of models, respectively. We also showed that some models (e.g. logistic, von Bertalanffy) were clearly inadequate. Thus, contrary to the widely held belief, the sigmoid character of a three or more parameter growth function is not sufficient for adequate fits.},

We assessed left ventricular volume and mass from 8 slices and during 12 phases of the cardiac cycle in seven patients with an anterior wall myocardial infarction; one patient was studied twice, leaving eight MR examinations to be evaluated. Purpose of this study was to assess the intra-observer and inter-observer variability of epicardial volume, endocardial volume, and left ventricular mass from contours manually traced by two independent observers. For the eight MR examinations, epicardial volume was found to be 292 +/- 51 ml (mean +/- SD) at end-diastole, which decreased to 237 +/- 55 ml at end-systole. Endocardial volume was 141 +/- 31 ml at end-diastole, which decreased to 79 +/- 27 ml at end-systole. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 45 +/- 8\%. Mean left ventricular mass, when averaged over all patient studies and all phases, was 159 +/- 30 g. Intra-observer and inter-observer variability were found to be 3.5\% and 5.2\% for endocardial volume, 2.0\% and 2.5\% for epicardial volume, and 3.6\% and 3.6\% for left ventricular mass, respectively. The contour analysis showed a statistically significant phase effect in the endocardial contour in the midventricular slices, which was resolved after establishing a more precise definition for the tracing of the endocardial border. In conclusion, left ventricular volume and mass in patients with an anterior wall myocardial infarction can be assessed with high reproducibility and reliability from manual contour tracings. A precise protocol for the definition of endocardial and epicardial contours is required to obtain reproducible and reliable results.},

  abstract = {Objective of review Acute otitis media (AOM) is the largest cause of antimicrobial prescriptions amongst children in developed countries. Excessive and inappropriate prescribing is known to drive antimicrobial resistance, but less is known of antimicrobial resistance in AOM-associated bacteria. Type of review \& search strategy We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of bacterial prevalence and antimicrobial resistance in studies of paediatric AOM identified from Ovid Medline, Embase and the Cochrane library. Results From 48 unique studies, 15,871 samples were included. Only 0.67 (CI 0.63–0.71) of all ear samples grew a bacterial pathogen. The most common bacterial causes of AOM in children were Streptococcus pneumoniae 0.30 (CI 0.27–0.32), Haemophilus influenza 0.23 (CI 0.20–0.26), and Moraxella catarrhalis 0.05 (CI 0.04–0.06). Resistance patterns varied amongst organisms and antimicrobial agents. The pooled proportion of bacterial culture-positive episodes of AOM that could be effectively treated with amoxicillin was 0.85 (CI 0.76–0.94), erythromycin was 0.64 (0.48–0.78) and amoxicillin-clavulanate was 0.95 (CI 0.85–0.98). Conclusion We have demonstrated the bacteriology and antimicrobial resistance patterns of AOM. Of samples which grew bacteria, on average approximately 15\% of isolates demonstrated resistance to amoxicillin; a typical first-line agent. Greater understanding of local bacteriology and resistance patterns is needed to enable improved antimicrobial stewardship.},

  abstract = {Laparoscopic surgery technology continues to advance. However, much less attention has been focused on how alteration of the laparoscopic surgical environment might improve clinical outcomes. We conducted a randomized, 2\,×\,2 factorial trial to evaluate whether low intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) (8\,mmHg) and/or warmed, humidified CO2 (WH) gas are better for minimizing the adverse impact of a CO2 pneumoperitoneum on the peritoneal environment during laparoscopic surgery and for improving clinical outcomes compared to the standard IPP (12\,mmHg) and/or cool and dry CO2 (CD) gas. Herein we show that low IPP and WH gas may decrease inflammation in the laparoscopic surgical environment, resulting in better clinical outcomes. Low IPP and/or WH gas significantly lowered expression of inflammation-related genes in peritoneal tissues compared to the standard IPP and/or CD~gas. The odds ratios of a visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score {$>$}30 in the ward was 0.18 (95\% CI: 0.06, 0.52) at 12\,hours and 0.06 (95\% CI: 0.01, 0.26) at 24\,hours in the low IPP group versus the standard IPP group, and 0.16 (95\% CI: 0.05, 0.49) at 0\,hours and 0.29 (95\% CI: 0.10, 0.79) at 12\,hours in the WH gas group versus the CD gas group.},

Decannulation and absence of dyspnea after exertion were the criteria of successful management. The probability of decannulation over time was computed using the Kaplan-Meier technique. Cox multiple regression analysis was used to determine the effects of independent variables (age, sex, etiology, site of stenosis, length of stenosis, diameter of stenosis, and surgical technique) on treatment success. The only factors with a significant effect on the outcome were site of stenosis and diameter of stenosis. A classification into four clinical stages of stenosis based on site of lesion was shown to effectively predict the likelihood of successful decannulation.},

Prevalences of exertional leg symptoms other than intermittent claudication were 56.2\% (n=77), 42.3\% (n=11), and 19.0\% (n=20), respectively. Absence of exertional leg symptoms was reported by 15.3\% (n=21), 53.8\% (n=14), and 77.1\% (n=81), respectively. Among patients with PAD, older age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, and group 2 vs group 1 status were associated independently with absence of exertional leg symptoms in multivariable regression analysis. Lower ankle-brachial index levels and group 1 vs group 2 status were associated with intermittent claudication.Clinical manifestations of PAD are diverse, particularly among patients identified by ankle-brachial index screening. Exertional leg symptoms other than intermittent claudication are common in PAD. Patients with PAD who are older, male, diabetic, or identified with ankle-brachial index screening in a primary care setting are more likely to have asymptomatic PAD.Arch Intern Med. 1999;159:387-392--{$>$}},

  abstract = {Objective To develop an evidence-based guideline for Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) for systematic reviews (SRs), health technology assessments, and other evidence syntheses. Study Design and Setting An SR, Web-based survey of experts, and consensus development forum were undertaken to identify checklists that evaluated or validated electronic literature search strategies and to determine which of their elements related to search quality or errors. Results Systematic review: No new search elements were identified for addition to the existing (2008–2010) PRESS 2015 Evidence-Based Checklist, and there was no evidence refuting any of its elements. Results suggested that structured PRESS could identify search errors and improve the selection of search terms. Web-based survey of experts: Most respondents felt that peer review should be undertaken after the MEDLINE search had been prepared but before it had been translated to other databases. Consensus development forum: Of the seven original PRESS elements, six were retained: translation of the research question; Boolean and proximity operators; subject headings; text word search; spelling, syntax and line numbers; and limits and filters. The seventh (skilled translation of the search strategy to additional databases) was removed, as there was consensus that this should be left to the discretion of searchers. An updated PRESS 2015 Guideline Statement was developed, which includes the following four documents: PRESS 2015 Evidence-Based Checklist, PRESS 2015 Recommendations for Librarian Practice, PRESS 2015 Implementation Strategies, and PRESS 2015 Guideline Assessment Form. Conclusion The PRESS 2015 Guideline Statement should help to guide and improve the peer review of electronic literature search strategies.},

Modifications to the PRISMA statement reflect the specific requirements for reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy studies and the abstracts for these reviews.Established standards from the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network were followed for the development of the guideline. The original PRISMA statement was used as a framework on which to modify and add items. A group of 24 multidisciplinary experts used a systematic review of articles on existing reporting guidelines and methods, a 3-round Delphi process, a consensus meeting, pilot testing, and iterative refinement to develop the PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline. The final version of the PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline checklist was approved by the group.The systematic review (produced 64 items) and the Delphi process (provided feedback on 7 proposed items; 1 item was later split into 2 items) identified 71 potentially relevant items for consideration. The Delphi process reduced these to 60 items that were discussed at the consensus meeting. Following the meeting, pilot testing and iterative feedback were used to generate the 27-item PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy checklist. To reflect specific or optimal contemporary systematic review methods for diagnostic test accuracy, 8 of the 27 original PRISMA items were left unchanged, 17 were modified, 2 were added, and 2 were omitted.The 27-item PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy checklist provides specific guidance for reporting of systematic reviews. The PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline can facilitate the transparent reporting of reviews, and may assist in the evaluation of validity and applicability, enhance replicability of reviews, and make the results from systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies more useful.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Multisite photoplethysmography (PPG) cardiovascular assessments can evaluate endothelial, peripheral autonomic and arterial dysfunction. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the potential clinical utility of the technology in assessing patients with SSc and primary RP (PRP). METHODS: Multisite PPG pulse measurements, a reference ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) and a full clinical assessment were undertaken for three subject groups: SSc, PRP and controls. Endothelial and autonomic function and arterial disease measures were obtained using pulse wave analysis. RESULTS: Nineteen SSc, 19 PRP and 23 control subjects were assessed and compared. Endothelial function was significantly impaired in SSc (P \textbackslash textless 0.02), but with no difference between controls and PRP. Receiver operating characteristic-based classification accuracy was 81\% (sensitivity 90\%, specificity 74\%) for separating SSc from controls and 82\% (sensitivity 84\%, specificity 79\%) for separating SSc from PRP. SSc patients with digital ulcers had significantly lower endothelial function compared with those without ulcers (P \textbackslash textless 0.05). Autonomic dysfunction was suggested in both SSc and PRP and was most exaggerated in patients with diffuse SSc. All groups had overall normal ABPI and arterial stiffness timing measures. Bilateral timing differences at the toes, which represents peripheral occlusive arterial disease, did show increased asymmetry in SSc (P \textbackslash textless 0.02). CONCLUSION: Multisite PPG pulse technology showed potential diagnostic ability. By using measures of endothelial function, it differentiated SSc from control and PRP subjects with an accuracy of at least 81\%. Objective pulse-derived measures of autonomic function and arterial disease in SSc have also been reported in this pilot study.},

This review—which is based on available evidence from randomised trials, systematic reviews, and expert consensus—discusses the clinical importance of self measurement of blood pressure in establishing the diagnosis of hypertension, in subsequent titration of drugs, and in longer term monitoring.Sources and selection criteriaWe extracted key studies from a Medline search for randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews to the end of 2007. These were supplemented by data from the personal references of study group members. After an open conference in early July 2008, at which the main data from the literature were presented, the group held a writing day to distil what was known and unknown for a series of questions for self monitoring of hypertension.Self monitoring of blood pressure is when a person (or carer) measures their own blood pressure outside the clinic—at home, in the workplace, or elsewhere.4 Self monitoring allows multiple measurements and therefore provides a more precise …}

The authors report smaller differences between ambulatory and clinic measurements when a non-physician made the measurements than current guidelines imply, particularly at near normal values.2 3 As previously reported, measurements taken by physicians were significantly higher. Although international guidelines agree that ambulatory readings are lower than those measured in clinic, diagnostic and treatment thresholds for ambulatory measurements vary considerably, despite near unanimous agreement for clinic thresholds.2 3 Better agreement on ambulatory thresholds would allow comparisons between countries and reduce confusion for clinicians.The key messages from this work are that the difference between blood pressure measurements taken by physicians and nurses in the clinic is bigger than that between measurements taken …}

  abstract = {Heart failure is now recognised as a major and escalating public health problem in industrialised countries with ageing populations. Any attempt to describe the epidemiology, aetiology, and prognosis of heart failure, however, must take account of the difficulty in defining exactly what heart failure is. Though the focus of this article is the symptomatic syndrome it must be remembered that as many patients again may have asymptomatic disease that might be legitimately labelled “heart failure”—for example, asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. More comprehensive reviews of the epidemiology and associated burden of heart failure have been published by McMurray and colleagues1 and more recently by Cowie and colleagues.2 Data relating to the aetiology, epidemiology and prognostic implications of heart failure are principally available from five types of studies: Cross sectional and longitudinal follow up surveys of well defined populations. These have almost exclusively focused on those individuals with clinical signs and symptoms indicative of chronic heart failure. Cross sectional surveys of individuals who have been medically treated for signs and symptoms of heart failure within a well defined region. Echocardiographic surveys of individuals within a well defined population to determine the presence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Nation wide studies of annual trends in heart failure related hospitalisation identified on the basis of diagnostic coding at discharge. Comprehensive clinical registries collected in conjunction with clinical trials. These include a large proportion of individuals who were identified on the basis of having both impaired left ventricular systolic dysfunction and signs and symptoms of heart failure. Within the context of the specific limitations of the type of data available from these studies, the current understanding of the aetiology, epidemiology, and prognostic implications of chronic heart failure are discussed here.

  abstract = {This article is part of a series of papers examining ethical issues in cluster randomized trials (CRTs) in health research. In the introductory paper in this series, we set out six areas of inquiry that must be addressed if the cluster trial is to be set on a firm ethical foundation. This paper addresses the second of the questions posed, namely, from whom, when, and how must informed consent be obtained in CRTs in health research? The ethical principle of respect for persons implies that researchers are generally obligated to obtain the informed consent of research subjects. Aspects of CRT design, including cluster randomization, cluster level interventions, and cluster size, present challenges to obtaining informed consent. Here we address five questions related to consent and CRTs: How can a study proceed if informed consent is not possible? Is consent to randomization always required? What information must be disclosed to potential subjects if their cluster has already been randomized? Is passive consent a valid substitute for informed consent? Do health professionals have a moral obligation to participate as subjects in CRTs designed to improve professional practice?We set out a framework based on the moral foundations of informed consent and international regulatory provisions to address each of these questions. First, when informed consent is not possible, a study may proceed if a research ethics committee is satisfied that conditions for a waiver of consent are satisfied. Second, informed consent to randomization may not be required if it is not possible to approach subjects at the time of randomization. Third, when potential subjects are approached after cluster randomization, they must be provided with a detailed description of the interventions in the trial arm to which their cluster has been randomized; detailed information on interventions in other trial arms need not be provided. Fourth, while passive consent may serve a variety of practical ends, it is not a substitute for valid informed consent. Fifth, while health professionals may have a moral obligation to participate as subjects in research, this does not diminish the necessity of informed consent to study participation.},

The analysis was performed from a UK NHS perspective and the estimates for mortality, adverse events, and cross-sectional NYHA class were obtained from the EVEREST II High Risk Study (HRS). Utility decrements were obtained from a heath technology assessment on Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, while unit costs were obtained from national databases. The concept model was clinically validated. Costs (2011 £UK) and benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5\%.Results:Compared to medical management, over 2- and 10-year periods MitraClip had incremental Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gains of 0.48 and 2.04, respectively. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios for MitraClip at 2 and 10 years are £52,947 and £14,800 per QALY gained. Overall, the model was most sensitive to the choice of time horizon, the discount rate applied to benefits, the starting age of cohort, the utility decrement associated with NYHA II, and cost of the MitraClip procedure. The model was insensitive to changes in all other parameters. MitraClip was also found to be cost-effective, regardless of the modelling approach, and insensitive to the key assumptions of the procedure cost.Study limitations:The primary limitation of the analysis is the reliance on aggregate data from a modestly sized non-randomized study with a short-term follow-up period. Aligned to this was the need to extrapolate survival well beyond the study period in order to generate meaningful results. The impact of both of these limitations was explored via extensive sensitivity analyses.Conclusion:Compared to medical management, MitraClip is a cost-effective interventional procedure at conventional threshold values.},

  abstract = {Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is defined as the average pressure throughout the cardiac cycle.1 It has physiologic and clinical importance since it represents the perfusion pressure and it is a factor utilised in the calculation of haemodynamic variables. Based on the normal blood pressure curve configuration, the functional MAP is lower than the arithmetic one (pulse pressure/2). For many years, MAP has been calculated by blood pressure cuff measurements using an empiric formula, which states that the MAP equals one third of the distance between the systolic pressure (SP) and the diastolic pressure (DP).2 3 Since the true mean pressure is the time–weight average of a series of instantaneous pressures, the above formula has substantial limitations.4 This article proposes a more precise formula for the estimation of mean arterial pressure. A nomogram for the calculation of MAP is also provided.The blood pressure tracings and haemodynamic data of 150 patients who underwent cardiac catheterisation were analysed.

Design and method: Five elite cricketers were interviewed alongside edited video footage of their batting innings. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather in-depth information and explanations about the participants' use of self-talk during each critical incident. Results and conclusions: The findings of this study highlighted the use of instructional and motivational self-talk as a fluctuating continual narrative that enhanced skill execution, self-efficacy and focus of attention, whilst reducing performance anxiety. In particular, the athletes described the effectiveness of self-determined self-talk on their performance. Specifically, they advocated self-talk that narrowed their attentional focus and redirected their thoughts to performance-related cues during periods of declining performance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Children performing these tasks exhibited distributions of gaze steps that were closest to power-law or lognormal distributions, suggesting a multiplicatively interactive, flexible, self-organizing cognitive system rather than a component-dominant stipulated cognitive structure. Younger children and children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibited distributions that were closer to power-law than lognormal, indicating a reduced degree of self-organized structure. The relative goodness of lognormal fit was also a significant predictor of ASD, suggesting that this type of analysis may point towards a promising diagnostic tool. These results lend further support to an interaction-dominant framework that casts cognitive processing and development in terms of self-organization instead of fixed components and show that these analytical methods are sensitive to important developmental and neuropsychological differences.},

Therapy options were evaluated using a Medline search, including only publications in English between 2000-2012. Key words used were: SUI, conservative and surgical treatment, midurethral sling, colposuspension. Surgical treatment options demonstrate significantly better results than conservative treatment. MUS demonstrate better subjective and objective cure rates than colposuspension; it is less invasive and more cost-effective. First line SUI therapy such as RP MUS and TVT seem to be favored when compared to transobturator techniques. Retropubic and transobturator MUS showed equivalent objective and subjective success rates. Open colposuspension is an effective treatment possibility for recurrent SUI after failed MUS. TVT, compared with other MUS, seems to show slightly better cure rates. but perioperative complications appear to be similar. Long-term results (\textbackslash textgreater10 years) of repeated SUI surgery showed that the Burch procedure had the lowest 9-year cumulative incidence of repeat SUI surgery. Mini-sling techniques may be underestimated but long-time results are pending and closer monitoring of the adverse event profile must be carried out. MUS are first choice in the treatment of SUI, of which TVT, has the best cure rate. Colpussupension continues to have its place in recurrent SUI. The new mini-MUS needs a longer follow-up for final evaluation.},

A novel multistage hybrid appearance model methodology is presented in which a hybrid active shape model/active appearance model (AAM) stage helps avoid local minima of the matching function. This yields an overall more favorable matching result. An automated initialization method is introduced making the approach fully automated. Our method was trained in a set of 102 MR images and tested in a separate set of 60 images. In all testing cases, the matching resulted in a visually plausible and accurate mapping of the model to the image data. Average signed border positioning errors did not exceed 0.3 mm in any of the three determined contours-left-ventricular (LV) epicardium, LV and right-ventricular (RV) endocardium. The area measurements derived from the three contours correlated well with the independent standard (r = 0.96, 0.96, 0.90), with slopes and intercepts of the regression lines close to one and zero, respectively. Testing the reproducibility of the method demonstrated an unbiased performance with small range of error as assessed via Bland-Altman statistic. In direct border positioning error comparison, the multistage method significantly outperformed the conventional AAM (p \textbackslash textless 0.001). The developed method promises to facilitate fully automated quantitative analysis of LV and RV morphology and function in clinical setting.},

Comprehensive design of a three-dimensional (3-D) active appearance model (AAM) is reported for the first time as an involved extension of the AAM framework introduced by Cootes et al. The model's behavior is learned from manually traced segmentation examples during an automated training stage. Information about shape and image appearance of the cardiac structures is contained in a single model. This ensures a spatially and/or temporally consistent segmentation of three-dimensional cardiac images. The clinical potential of the 3-D AAM is demonstrated in short-axis cardiac MR images and four-chamber echocardiographic sequences. The method's performance was assessed by comparison with manually identified independent standards in 56 clinical MR and 64 clinical echo image sequences. The AAM method showed good agreement with the independent standard using quantitative indexes of border positioning errors, endo- and epicardial volumes, and left ventricular mass. In MR, the endocardial volumes, epicardial volumes, and left ventricular wall mass correlation coefficients between manual and AAM were R2 = 0.94, 0.97, 0.82, respectively. For echocardiographic analysis, the area correlation was R2 = 0.79. The AAM method shows high promise for successful application to MR and echocardiographic image analysis in a clinical setting.},

Cells held under voltage-clamp control are stimulated by step pulses to elicit reproducible hyperpolarization- or depolarization-induced ciliary motor responses. High-speed video recording at 200 fields per second is used for imaging ciliary organelles of the same cell in two perspectives: the axial view and, following cell rotation by 90°, the lateral view. From video sequences of typically 1 s, the contours of the cirral images are determined and digitized. Computer programs are established to (1) reduce an observed image to a “ciliary axis”, (2) sort series of axes by template to generate an averaged ciliary cycle in 2D-projection, and (3) to associate the generalized axial and lateral 2D-images for generation of a sequence of three-dimensional images, which quantitatively represent the cycle in space and time. The method allows us to produce pre-determined perspectives of images selected from the ciliary cycle, and to generate stereo views for graphical representation of ciliary motion. The approach includes a potential for extraction of the complete microtubular sliding program of a cilium under reproducible electric stimulation of the ciliary membrane.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of case mix adjustment methods used to derive standardised mortality ratios for hospitals, by examining the consistency of relations between risk factors and mortality across hospitals. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of routinely collected hospital data comparing observed deaths with deaths predicted by the Dr Foster Unit case mix method. SETTING: Four acute National Health Service hospitals in the West Midlands (England) with case mix adjusted standardised mortality ratios ranging from 88 to 140. PARTICIPANTS: 96 948 (April 2005 to March 2006), 126 695 (April 2006 to March 2007), and 62 639 (April to October 2007) admissions to the four hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of large interaction effects between case mix variable and hospital in a logistic regression model indicating non-constant risk relations, and plausible mechanisms that could give rise to these effects. RESULTS: Large significant (P\textbackslash textlessor=0.0001) interaction effects were seen with several case mix adjustment variables. For two of these variables-the Charlson (comorbidity) index and emergency admission-interaction effects could be explained credibly by differences in clinical coding and admission practices across hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The Dr Foster Unit hospital standardised mortality ratio is derived from an internationally adopted/adapted method, which uses at least two variables (the Charlson comorbidity index and emergency admission) that are unsafe for case mix adjustment because their inclusion may actually increase the very bias that case mix adjustment is intended to reduce. Claims that variations in hospital standardised mortality ratios from Dr Foster Unit reflect differences in quality of care are less than credible.},

With a radio-frequency (RF) power source and controller, this implant produces sufficient light power for optogenetic stimulation with minimal tissue heating (\textbackslash textless1 [deg]C). We show how three adaptations of the implant allow for untethered optogenetic control throughout the nervous system (brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerve endings) of behaving mice.

Even where authors of linkage studies have attempted to estimate sensitivity and specificity based on subjects with known status, the effects of false negatives and positives on event rates and estimates of effect are not often described.  Methods We present quantification of the effect of sensitivity and specificity of the linkage process on event rates and incidence, as well as the resultant effect on relative risks. Formulae to estimate the true number of events and estimated relative risk adjusted for given linkage sensitivity and specificity are then derived and applied to data from a prisoner mortality study. The implications of false positive and false negative matches are also discussed.  Discussion Comparisons of the effect of sensitivity and specificity on incidence and relative risks indicate that it is more important for linkages to be highly specific than sensitive, particularly if true incidence rates are low. We would recommend that, where possible, some quantitative estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the linkage process be performed, allowing the effect of these quantities on observed results to be assessed.},

Gestational age (GA) varied from 21 to 38 weeks. FHRPs were classified based on the fHR standard deviation. In sleep states, we observed that vagal influence increased with GA, and entropy significantly increased (decreased) with GA (SDNN/RMSSD), demonstrating that a prevalence of vagal activity with autonomous nervous system maturation may be associated with increased sleep state complexity. In active wakefulness, we observed a significant negative (positive) correlation of short-term (long-term) variability parameters with SDNN/RMSSD. ANOVA statistics demonstrated that long-term irregularity and standard deviation of normal-to-normal beat intervals (SDNN) best differentiated among fHRPs. Our results confirm that short- and long-term variability parameters are useful to differentiate between quiet and active states, and that entropy improves the characterization of sleep states. All measures differentiated fHRPs more effectively on very short HR series, as a result of the fMCG high temporal resolution and of the intrinsic timescales of the events that originate the different fHRPs.},

  abstract = {Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Screening for AF in asymptomatic patients has been proposed as a way of reducing the burden of the disease by detecting people who would benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation therapy prior to the onset of symptoms. However, for screening to be an effective intervention it must improve the detection of AF and provide benefit for those who are detected earlier as a result of screening.Objectives: The primary objective of this review was to examine whether screening programmes increase the detection of new cases of AF compared to routine practice. The secondary objectives were to identify which combination of screening strategy and patient population is most effective, as well as assessing any safety issues associated with screening, its acceptability within the target population and the costs involved.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) up to March 2012. Other relevant research databases, trials registries and websites were searched up to June 2012. Reference lists of identified studies were also searched for potentially relevant studies and we contacted corresponding authors for information about additional published or unpublished studies that may be relevant. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies comparing screening for AF with routine practice in people aged 40 years and over were eligible. Two authors (PM, CT or MF) independently selected the trials for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Assessment of risk of bias and data extraction were performed independently by two authors (PM, CT). Odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were used to present the results for the primary outcome, which is a dichotomous variable. Since only one included study was identified, no meta-analysis was performed.Main results: One cluster randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria for this review. This study compared systematic screening (by invitation to have an electrocardiogram (ECG)) and opportunistic screening (pulse palpation during a general practitioner (GP) consultation for any reason followed by an ECG if pulse was irregular) to routine practice (normal case finding on the basis of clinical presentation) in people aged 65 years or older. The risk of bias in the included study was judged to be low.Both systematic and opportunistic screening of people over the age of 65 years are more effective than routine practice (OR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.08 to 2.26 and OR 1.58, 95\% CI 1.10 to 2.29, respectively). The number needed to screen in order to detect one additional case compared to routine practice was 172 (95\% CI 94 to 927) for systematic screening and 167 (95\% CI 92 to 806) for opportunistic screening. Both systematic and opportunistic screening were more effective in men (OR 2.68, 95\% CI 1.51 to 4.76 and OR 2.33, 95\% CI 1.29 to 4.19, respectively) than in women (OR 0.98, 95\% CI 0.59 to 1.62 and OR 1.2, 95\% CI 0.74 to 1.93, respectively). No data on the effectiveness of screening in different ethnic or socioeconomic groups were available. There were insufficient data to compare the effectiveness of screening programmes in different healthcare settings.Systematic screening was associated with a better overall uptake rate than opportunistic screening (53\% versus 46\%) except in the ? 75 years age group where uptake rates were similar (43\% versus 42\%). In both screening programmes men were more likely to participate than women (57\% versus 50\% in systematic screening, 49\% versus 41\% in opportunistic screening) and younger people (65 to 74 years) were more likely to participate than people aged 75 years and over (61\% versus 43\% systematic, 49\% versus 42\% opportunistic). No adverse events associated with screening were reported.The incremental cost per additional case detected by opportunistic screening was GBP 337, compared to GBP 1514 for systematic screening. All cost estimates were based on data from the single included trial, which was conducted in the UK between 2001 and 2003.Authors' conclusions: Systematic and opportunistic screening for AF increase the rate of detection of new cases compared with routine practice. While both approaches have a comparable effect on the overall AF diagnosis rate, the cost of systematic screening is significantly more than that of opportunistic screening from the perspective of the health service provider. The lack of studies investigating the effect of screening in other health systems and younger age groups means that caution needs to be exercised in relation to the transferability of these results beyond the setting and population in which the included study was conducted.Additional research is needed to examine the effectiveness of alternative screening strategies and to investigate the effect of the intervention on the risk of stroke for screened versus non-screened populations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Concerns have been raised about the safety of surgery for stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse using transvaginal mesh. We assessed adverse outcomes after first, single mesh procedures and comparable non-mesh procedures. METHODS We did a cohort study of women in Scotland aged 20 years or older undergoing a first, single incontinence procedure or prolapse procedure during 1997–98 to 2015–16 identified from a national hospital admission database. Primary outcomes were immediate postoperative complications and subsequent (within 5 years) readmissions for later postoperative complications, further incontinence surgery, or further prolapse surgery. Poisson regression models were used to compare outcomes after procedures carried out with and without mesh. FINDINGS Between April 1, 1997, and March 31, 2016, 16 660 women underwent a first, single incontinence procedure, 13 133 (79\%) of which used mesh. Compared with non-mesh open surgery (colposuspension), mesh procedures had a lower risk of immediate complications (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 0·44 [95\% CI 0·36–0·55]) and subsequent prolapse surgery (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0·30 [0·24–0·39]), and a similar risk of further incontinence surgery (0·90 [0·73–1·11]) and later complications (1·12 [0·98–1·27]); all ratios are for retropubic mesh. During the same time period, 18 986 women underwent a first, single prolapse procedure, 1279 (7\%) of which used mesh. Compared with non-mesh repair, mesh repair of anterior compartment prolapse was associated with a similar risk of immediate complications (aRR 0·93 [95\% CI 0·49–1·79]); an increased risk of further incontinence (aIRR 3·20 [2·06–4·96]) and prolapse surgery (1·69 [1·29–2·20]); and a substantially increased risk of later complications (3·15 [2·46–4·04]). Compared with non-mesh repair, mesh repair of posterior compartment prolapse was associated with a similarly increased risk of repeat prolapse surgery and later complications. No difference in any outcome was observed between vaginal and, separately, abdominal mesh repair of vaginal vault prolapse compared with vaginal non-mesh repair. INTERPRETATION Our results support the use of mesh procedures for incontinence, although further research on longer term outcomes would be beneficial. Mesh procedures for anterior and posterior compartment prolapse cannot be recommended for primary prolapse repair. Both vaginal and abdominal mesh procedures for vaginal vault prolapse repair are associated with similar effectiveness and complication rates to non-mesh vaginal repair. These results therefore do not clearly favour any particular vault repair procedure. FUNDING None.},

  abstract = {Physical techniques have always had a key role in medicine, and the second half of the 20th century in particular saw a revolution in medical diagnostic techniques with the development of key imaging instruments: x-ray imaging and emission tomography (nuclear imaging and PET), MRI, and ultrasound. These techniques use the full width of the electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma rays to radio waves, and sound. In most cases, the development of a medical imaging device was opportunistic; many scientists in physics laboratories were experimenting with simple x-ray images within the first year of the discovery of such rays, the development of the cyclotron and later nuclear reactors created the opportunity for nuclear medicine, and one of the co-inventors of MRI was initially attempting to develop an alternative to x-ray diffraction for the analysis of crystal structures. What all these techniques have in common is the brilliant insight of a few pioneering physical scientists and engineers who had the tenacity to develop their inventions, followed by a series of technical innovations that enabled the full diagnostic potential of these instruments to be realised. In this report, we focus on the key part played by these scientists and engineers and the new imaging instruments and diagnostic procedures that they developed. By bringing the key developments and applications together we hope to show the true legacy of physics and engineering in diagnostic medicine.},

The therapeutic management of patients diagnosed with heart failure is beyond the scope of this paper, as is detailed information about the possible diagnostic tests and strategies to establish or rule out heart failure, although the prevailing definitions and categorisations of the syndrome will be discussed. The guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and selected reviews provide up to date information on the diagnosis and therapeutic management of heart failure.2w4 w5 Heart failure is a syndrome with symptoms and signs caused by cardiac dysfunction, resulting in reduced longevity. To establish a diagnosis of heart failure, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines warrant the presence of symptoms and signs (tables 1 and 2), objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction (preferably by echocardiography), and, in case of remaining doubt, a favourable response to treatment directed towards heart failure.w5 To support the failing heart numerous compensatory mechanisms occur, including activation of the neurohormonal system.2 An increase in natriuretic peptide concentrations (particularly B type natriuretic peptide) is considered a hallmark of heart failure.View this table:In this windowIn a new window Table 1 \hspace{1em}European Society of Cardiology definition of heart failure View this table:In this windowIn a new window Table 2 \hspace{1em}Heart failure: symptoms and signs The diagnosis of heart failure, especially when relying solely on symptoms and signs (which is often the …},

SMRs for all causes and all malignant neoplasms were 81 and 84 respectively, demonstrating a 'healthy worker effect'. Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90\% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the results of iliac artery stent placement for the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lesions in 90 iliac arteries were treated in 65 patients with 111 Wallstents and 21 Palmaz stents. Stents were placed for symptoms of intermittent claudication classified as grade I, categories 1-3 by the SVS/ISCVS/SCVIR reporting standards. Sixty-two stenosed arteries and 28 chronically occluded arteries were treated. Patients were followed for up to 57.1 months (mean, 17.4 months +/- 14.9). RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 87 of 90 iliac limbs (97\%), with major complications in seven of 65 patients (11\%). The 30-day mortality was zero. Mean pressure gradients across stenoses improved from 14.7 mm Hg +/- 9.8 to 1.4 mm Hg +/- 1.4 (P \textbackslash textless.001). Ankle-brachial indices improved from 0.62 +/- 0.21 to 0.90 +/- 0.18 (P \textbackslash textless.001). With use of the Rutherford criteria, 84\% demonstrated +2 or +3 improvement. The cumulative patency rates were 77\%, 71\%, 62\%, and 62\% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years (standard error \{[\}SE] \textbackslash textless 10\%). Continued clinical and noninvasive test benefit was present in 80\%, 80\%, 73\%, and 73\% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively (SE \textbackslash textless 10\%). CONCLUSIONS: Significant hemodynamic improvement can be achieved by percutaneous stent placement, with excellent clinical results. Observed mortality in this series was zero, but major complications, requiring modification of the treatment plan, were seen in 11\% of patients. Clinical results were better than suggested using current accepting reporting standards for “patency.\{”\}.},

It follows that comparisons of therapeutic maneuvers are even more difficult. A system is proposed that is simple, reproducible, and based on a readily available reference standard. Endotracheal tubes, which are manufactured to high standards of precision and accuracy, can be used to determine the size of an obstructed airway at its smallest point. The endotracheal tube that will pass through the lumen, if one exists, and tolerate normal leak pressures (10 to 25 cm H2O), can be compared to the expected age-appropriate endotracheal tube size. By using the outside diameters of the endotracheal tubes, the maximum percentage of airway obstruction can be determined. We present a conversion of tube size to the proposed grading scale: grade I up to 50\% obstruction, grade II from 51\% to 70\%, and grade III above 70\% with any detectable lumen. An airway with no lumen is assigned to grade IV.},

The simulation is based on virtual composite sample generation and its transformation into the form of a three-dimensional resistor network. Average grain diameter and its statistical distribution, shell thickness and different dependencies of local shell conductivity on the distance from the grain surface can act as variables. The use of the modified iteration procedure based on the Kirkpatrick approach leads to direct current resistivity value. The results were obtained for the matrix size 100×100×100 units (with assumption 1 unit=1 μm). The dependency of conductivity on the grain filler concentration was studied for varying grain sizes, changing shell thickness and for different statistical distributions of these parameters. The obtained results of simulation are in general agreement with the experimental data.},

The aim of regional renal hypothermia in laparoscopic surgery is to limit ischemic injury and extend safe operative time. A reliable model for assessing renal ischemic injury exists in the field of nonheart beating donor renal transplantation. Hypothermic machine perfusion allows calculation of the pressure flow index and measurement of glutathione S-transferase in the perfusate. These parameters allow accurate assessment of the extent of renal damage. Materials and Methods The device incorporates a 2-layer cooling bag and coolant circuit. The system achieves hypothermia by circulating coolant across the surface of the kidney. Using 10 pigs individual kidneys were subjected to periods of renal ischemia with or without device in situ cooling. Each kidney was then machine perfused and assessed using nonheart beating donor viability criteria. Results The best performance of the device achieved a renal parenchymal temperature of 15C in 11.2 minutes (mean ± SD 21.4 ± 8.42). In the warm ischemia groups significant deterioration of pressure flow index compared to controls occurred by 60 minutes (p = 0.0001). In cooled kidneys at 60 minutes the mean pressure flow index was not significantly different from that in controls. Greater mean glutathione S-transferase measurements were associated with the warm ischemia groups. Conclusions Our study reinforces the efficacy of topical renal cooling in the laparoscopic setting. We report the use of assessment techniques capable of accurate quantitative measurement of renal injury in an animal model. Our cooling device is currently undergoing further development to enhance its efficiency.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Tumor progression is a complex, multistage process by which a normal cell undergoes genetic changes that result in phenotypic alterations and the acquisition of the ability to spread and colonize distant sites in the body. Although many factors regulate malignant tumor growth and spread, interactions between a tumor and its surrounding microenvironment result in the production of important protein products that are crucial to each step of tumor progression. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of degradative enzymes with clear links to malignancy. These enzymes are associated with tumor cell invasion of the basement membrane and stroma, blood vessel penetration, and metastasis. They have more recently been implicated in primary and metastatic tumor growth and angiogenesis, and they may even have a role in tumor promotion. This review outlines our current understanding of the MMP family, including the association of particular MMPs with malignant phenotypes and the role of MMPs in specific steps of the metastatic cascade. As scientific understanding of the MMPs has advanced, therapeutic strategies that capitalize on blocking the enzymes have rapidly developed. The preclinical and clinical evolution of the synthetic MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) is also examined, with the discussion encompassing important methodologic issues associated with determining clinical efficacy of MMPIs and other novel therapeutic agents.},

  abstract = {Background: Quantitative information on regional left ventricular volumes from real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic (RT3DE) images has significant clinical potential but needs validation. Aim: To validate these measurements against cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and test the feasibility of automated detection of regional wall motion (RWM) abnormalities from RT3DE data. Methods: RT3DE (Philips) and CMR (Siemens) images were obtained from 31 patients and analysed by using prototype software to semiautomatically calculate indices of regional left ventricular function, which were compared between RT3DE and CMR (linear regression, Bland–Altman). Additionally, CMR images were reviewed by an expert, whose RWM grades were used as a reference for automated classification of segments as normal or abnormal from RT3DE and from CMR images. For each modality, normal regional ejection fraction (REF) values were obtained from 15 patients with normal wall motion. In the remaining 16 patients, REFs were compared with thresholds that were derived from patients with normal wall motion and optimised using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: RT3DE measurements resulted in good agreement with CMR. Regional indices calculated in patients with normal wall motion varied between segments, but overall were similar between modalities. In patients with abnormal wall motion, RWM was graded as abnormal in 74\% segments. CMR and RT3DE thresholds were similar (16-segment average 55 (10)\% and 56 (7)\%, respectively). Automated interpretation resulted in good agreement with expert interpretation, similar for CMR and RT3DE (sensitivity 0.85, 0.84; specificity 0.81, 0.78; accuracy 0.84, 0.84, respectively). Conclusion: Analysis of RT3DE data provides accurate quantification of regional left ventricular function and allows semiautomated detection of RWM abnormalities, which is as accurate as the same algorithm applied to CMR images.},

We combined high-resolution eye tracking with computational modeling in a group of 10 high-functioning individuals with autism to address this issue. The group fixated the location of the mouth in facial expressions more than did matched controls, even when the mouth was not shown, even in faces that were inverted and most noticeably at latencies of 200-400 ms. Comparisons with a computational model of visual saliency argue that the abnormal bias for fixating the mouth in autism is not driven by an exaggerated sensitivity to the bottom-up saliency of the features, but rather by an abnormal top-down strategy for allocating visual attention.},

  abstract = {A central feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an impairment in 'social attention'-the prioritized processing of socially relevant information, e.g. the eyes and face. Socially relevant stimuli are also preferentially attended in a broader categorical sense, however: observers orient preferentially to people and animals (compared to inanimate objects) in complex natural scenes. To measure the scope of social attention deficits in autism, observers viewed alternating versions of a natural scene on each trial, and had to 'spot the difference' between them-where the difference involved either an animate or inanimate object. Change detection performance was measured as an index of attentional prioritization. Individuals with ASD showed the same prioritized social attention for animate categories as did control participants. This could not be explained by lower level visual factors, since the effects disappeared when using blurred or inverted images. These results suggest that social attention - and its impairment in autism - may not be a unitary phenomenon: impairments in visual processing of specific social cues may occur despite intact categorical prioritization of social agents. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A classifier was programmed to determine cluster stability and was validated in an independent cohort of new patients recruited to the registry (n = 245).\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nFINDINGS: Five clusters were identified. Cluster 1 (34\%) were atopic with early onset disease, cluster 2 (21\%) were obese with late onset disease, cluster 3 (15\%) had the least severe disease, cluster 4 (15\%) were the eosinophilic with late onset disease and cluster 5 (15\%) had significant fixed airflow obstruction. At follow-up, the proportion of subjects treated with oral corticosteroids increased in all groups with an increase in body mass index. Exacerbation frequency decreased significantly in clusters 1, 2 and 4 and was associated with a significant fall in the peripheral blood eosinophil count in clusters 2 and 4. Stability of cluster membership at follow-up was 52\% for the whole group with stability being best in cluster 2 (71\%) and worst in cluster 4 (25\%). In an independent validation cohort, the classifier identified the same 5 clusters with similar patient distribution and characteristics.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nINTERPRETATION: Statistical cluster analysis can identify distinct phenotypes with specific outcomes.

  abstract = {Background The use of transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) has gained widespread acceptance in Europe, but data on immediate success, safety, and long-term echocardiographic follow-up in real-world patients are still limited. Objectives The aim of this multinational registry is to present a real-world overview of TMVR use in Europe. Methods The Transcatheter Valve Treatment Sentinel Pilot Registry is a prospective, independent, consecutive collection of individual patient data. Results A total of 628 patients (mean age 74.2 ± 9.7 years, 63.1\% men) underwent TMVR between January 2011 and December 2012 in 25 centers in 8 European countries. The prevalent pathogenesis was functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) (n = 452 [72.0\%]). The majority of patients (85.5\%) were highly symptomatic (New York Heart Association functional class III or higher), with a high logistic EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) (20.4 ± 16.7\%). Acute procedural success was high (95.4\%) and similar in FMR and degenerative mitral regurgitation (p~= 0.662). One clip was implanted in 61.4\% of patients. In-hospital mortality was low (2.9\%), without significant differences between groups. The estimated 1-year mortality was 15.3\%, which was similar for FMR and degenerative mitral regurgitation. The estimated 1-year rate of rehospitalization because of heart failure was 22.8\%, significantly higher in the FMR group (25.8\% vs. 12.0\%, p[log-rank]~= 0.009). Paired echocardiographic data from the 1-year follow-up, available for 368 consecutive patients in 15 centers, showed a persistent reduction in the degree of mitral regurgitation at 1 year (6.0\% of patients with severe mitral regurgitation). Conclusions This independent, contemporary registry shows that TMVR is associated with high immediate success,~low complication rates, and sustained 1-year reduction of the severity of mitral regurgitation and improvement of clinical symptoms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unconscious survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have a high risk of death or poor neurologic function. Therapeutic hypothermia is recommended by international guidelines, but the supporting evidence is limited, and the target temperature associated with the best outcome is unknown. Our objective was to compare two target temperatures, both intended to prevent fever. METHODS: In an international trial, we randomly assigned 950 unconscious adults after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause to targeted temperature management at either 33°C or 36°C. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality through the end of the trial. Secondary outcomes included a composite of poor neurologic function or death at 180 days, as evaluated with the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale and the modified Rankin scale. RESULTS: In total, 939 patients were included in the primary analysis. At the end of the trial, 50\% of the patients in the 33°C group (235 of 473 patients) had died, as compared with 48\% of the patients in the 36°C group (225 of 466 patients) (hazard ratio with a temperature of 33°C, 1.06; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 1.28; P=0.51). At the 180-day follow-up, 54\% of the patients in the 33°C group had died or had poor neurologic function according to the CPC, as compared with 52\% of patients in the 36°C group (risk ratio, 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.88 to 1.16; P=0.78). In the analysis using the modified Rankin scale, the comparable rate was 52\% in both groups (risk ratio, 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.14; P=0.87). The results of analyses adjusted for known prognostic factors were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In unconscious survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause, hypothermia at a targeted temperature of 33°C did not confer a benefit as compared with a targeted temperature of 36°C.

Assessment variables included a 24-hour pad weighing test, a stress test, visual analog scale for assessing the degree of bother, and a questionnaire assessing the subjective perception of the women on their continence status.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: The follow-up time was a mean of 91 months (range 78-100 months). Both objective and subjective cure rates were 81.3\% for the 80 women available for follow-up. Asymptomatic pelvic organ prolapse was found in 7.8\%, de novo urge symptoms in 6.3\%, and recurrent urinary tract infection in 7.5\% of the women. No other long-term adverse effects of the procedure were detected.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSION: The tension-free vaginal tape procedure for treatment of female urinary stress incontinence is effective over a period of 7 years.},

However, this is not feasible for complex 3D +time structures, such as the cardiac left ventricle, due to increased training requirements, aligning difficulties and local minima in resulting models. As our main contribution, we present an alternate bottom-up modelling approach. By combining the variation captured in multiple dimensionally-targeted models at segmentation-time we create a scalable segmentation framework that does not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality." Our second contribution involves a flexible contour coupling technique that allows our segmentation method to adapt to unseen contour configurations outside the training set. This is used to identify the endo- and epicardium contours of the left ventricle by coupling them at segmentation-time, instead of at model-time. We apply our approach to 33 3D +time cardiac MRI datasets and perform comprehensive evaluation against several state-of-the-art works. Quantitative evaluation illustrates that our method requires significantly less training than state-of-the-art model-based methods, while maintaining or improving segmentation accuracy.},

Our aim was to assess if warmed and humidified CO2 insufflation with HumiGard? device can achieve significant benefits over standard insufflation in terms of risk of hypothermia, cytokine response, blood gases, and intra- and postoperative parameters, in the setting of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).Methods:This was a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. Sixty-four patients with prostate cancer undergoing RARP were randomized to receive warmed and humidified CO2 insufflation with HumiGard device, plus hot air warming blanket (treatment group, H?+?WB), or standard CO2 insufflation, plus hot air warming blanket (control group, WB). Body core temperature (BCT), plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, pain scores, and intraoperative parameters were recorded. The data were analyzed according to the Bayesian paradigm.Results:Intraoperative BCT increased in both groups during surgery, with a statistically significant difference favoring group H?+?WB, ending at 0.2°C higher on average than group WB. No difference across groups was shown for cytokine levels. Blood gas parameters were not affected by warmed CO2 insufflation. No statistical differences were noted for pain scores and the other intra- and postoperative parameters.Conclusions:During RARP, warm and humidified CO2 insufflation with the HumiGard device was more effective than the standard CO2 insufflation in maintaining the patient?s heat homeostasis, even if the difference was minimal. No imbalances were detected on blood gas analyses. No benefit could be shown in terms of cytokine levels and pain scores.},

  abstract = {Conventional clinical trial design involves considerations of power, and sample size is typically chosen to achieve a desired power conditional on a specified treatment effect. In practice, there is considerable uncertainty about what the true underlying treatment effect may be, and so power does not give a good indication of the probability that the trial will demonstrate a positive outcome. Assurance is the unconditional probability that the trial will yield a 'positive outcome'. A positive outcome usually means a statistically significant result, according to some standard frequentist significance test. The assurance is then the prior expectation of the power, averaged over the prior distribution for the unknown true treatment effect. We argue that assurance is an important measure of the practical utility of a proposed trial, and indeed that it will often be appropriate to choose the size of the sample (and perhaps other aspects of the design) to achieve a desired assurance, rather than to achieve a desired power conditional on an assumed treatment effect. We extend the theory of assurance to two-sided testing and equivalence trials. We also show that assurance is straightforward to compute in some simple problems of normal, binary and gamma distributed data, and that the method is not restricted to simple conjugate prior distributions for parameters. Several illustrations are given. Copyright 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

His proposals are found to suffer from serious flaws in statistical and health economic reasoning. Nuijten's suggestions for incorporating uncertainty: (a) wrongly interpret the p-value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true; (b) represent this probability wrongly by truncating the input distribution; and (c) in the specific example of an antiparkinsonian drug uses a completely inappropriate p-value of 0.05 when the null hypothesis would, in reality, be emphatically disproved by the data. His suggestions regarding minimum important differences in cost effective-ness: (a) introduce areas of indifference that suggest inappropriate reliance on cost minimisation while failing to recognise that decisions should be based on expected costs versus benefits; and (b) offer no guidance on how the probabilities associated with these areas could be used in decision-making. Furthermore, Nuijten's model for Parkinson's disease is over-simplified to the point of provid-ing a bad example of modelling practice, which may mislead the readers of PharmacoEconomics. The rationale for this paper is to ensure that readers do not apply inappropriate analyses as a result of following the proposals contained in Nuijten's paper. In addition to a detailed critique of Nuijten's proposals, we provide brief summaries of the currently accepted best practice in cost-effectiveness decision-making under uncertainty.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To test the null hypothesis that a novel disposable "tampon like" electrostimulation device (Pelviva(®)) is no better than unsupervised pelvic floor muscle exercise for treatment of urinary incontinence in women.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS: Pre/post-intervention assessor blinded, single center RCT. A total of 123 community dwelling self referred women with symptoms of stress, urge, or mixed incontinence were randomly assigned to one of two 12-week duration treatments: Pelviva(®) used for 30 min a day plus unsupervised pelvic floor muscle exercise or unsupervised exercises alone. Outcome measures included ICIQ-UI (primary), ICIQ FLUTSex and global impression of severity and improvement (secondary) completed at recruitment, after 4 weeks of unsupervised exercise and immediately post-treatment. Diary of exercise frequency/type, overall impression, and usage of device was completed mid- and post-treatment.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: Pelviva(®) plus exercise produced significantly better outcome than unsupervised exercise alone: 5 points (45\%) versus 1 point (10\%) for ICIQ-UI (P = 0.014); 67\% versus 33\% for leak frequency (P = 0.005); 40\% versus 20\% for leak interference with life (P = 0.018). Incontinence was less bothersome during sex to a greater extent in the Pelviva(®) group (P = 0.026). Women were enthusiastic about the device, found it comfortable/easy to use and experienced no adverse events.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: The Pelviva(®) device plus unsupervised exercise is more successful than unsupervised pelvic floor muscle exercise alone in treating urinary incontinence. The device is easy/comfortable to use, there are no apparent adverse incidents, and women can manage their incontinence in the privacy of their own home. The product will be launched 2013.},

  abstract = {BackgroundPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition that causes significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy, and can have a serious economic impact. It is often underdiagnosed in primary care, partially due to the fact that the current National Institute for Health Care and Excellence-recommended ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) test for PAD in primary care is time-consuming and is technically challenging to perform. The availability of a simple, reliable diagnostic test has the potential to facilitate early PAD identification and treatment.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to evaluate the preferences of primary care practitioners relating to the key characteristics for a new medical device for PAD detection.ParticipantsA sample of 116 UK primary care setting clinicians involved in the diagnosis and/or management of PAD, comprising of doctors (n = 95), nurses (n = 17), health care assistants (n = 1) and other unspecified clinicians (n = 3).OutcomesRelative weights derived from a discrete choice experiment (DCE), by primary care practitioners regarding six key characteristics of the new device: device display, data integration, training, power supply, portability of the device, and cost.ResultsFive characteristics were important for preferences. Practitioners favoured manual, as opposed to automated, integration of test results into patient records. Practitioners strongly preferred disposable batteries as the power supply for the device compared with other alternatives.ConclusionsThis novel study has successfully utilised a DCE to elicit primary care practitioner’s preferences for the development of the new device. The preferences can help inform device design and therefore facilitate/help to maximise its uptake and buy-in from the outset.},

  abstract = {Objective: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has become an established treatment of traumatic and infected wounds. Negative pressure wound therapy with instillation (NPWTi) is a further development that combines the conventional NPWT with instillation of different fluids which continuously administer therapeutic reagents to the wound. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of additional saline instillation in NPWTi to NPWT alone. Method: Between January and July 2014, consecutive patients with acute wounds of the lower limb were treated with NPWTi with saline instillation. The number of revision surgeries, length of hospital stay, and duration of treatment until final healing were recorded and compared with matched patients undergoing NPWT without instillation. Results: There were 10 patients recruited with 10 matched controls examined restrospectivley. Patients who received NPWTi were found to have decreased time of hospitalisation (21.5 versus 26.5 days, p=0.43), and accelerated wound healing (9.0 versus 12.5 days, p=0.36) than patients who received NPWT. However, the difference in the outcomes of the patients who received NPWTi and patients who received NPWT was not found to be statisticallly significant. Conclusion: NPWTi with instillation of saline is a promising method and its effectiveness needs to be tested in a randomised controlled trial compared with NPWT alone. Declaration of interest: This study obtained support by KCI (Wiebsaden, Germany) for the surgical material.},

Percutaneous coronary intervention with hemodynamic support may be feasible for these patients. Currently, there is no systematic comparative evaluation of hemodynamic support devices for this indication.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned 452 symptomatic patients with complex 3-vessel disease or unprotected left main coronary artery disease and severely depressed left ventricular function to intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) (n=226) or Impella 2.5 (n=226) support during nonemergent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary end point was the 30-day incidence of major adverse events. A 90-day follow-up was required, as well, by protocol. Impella 2.5 provided superior hemodynamic support in comparison with IABP, with maximal decrease in cardiac power output from baseline of -0.04±0.24 W in comparison with -0.14±0.27 W for IABP (P=0.001). The primary end point (30-day major adverse events) was not statistically different between groups: 35.1\% for Impella 2.5 versus 40.1\% for IABP, P=0.227 in the intent-to-treat population and 34.3\% versus 42.2\%, P=0.092 in the per protocol population. At 90 days, a strong trend toward decreased major adverse events was observed in Impella 2.5-supported patients in comparison with IABP: 40.6\% versus 49.3\%, P=0.066 in the intent-to-treat population and 40.0\% versus 51.0\%, P=0.023 in the per protocol population, respectively.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: The 30-day incidence of major adverse events was not different for patients with IABP or Impella 2.5 hemodynamic support.

  abstract = {Acute renal failure (ARF) can complicate up to 60\% of orthotopic liver transplants (OLT). The RIFLE criteria were developed to provide a consensus definition for acute renal disease in critically ill patients. Using the RIFLE criteria, we aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for ARF and acute renal injury (ARI), and to evaluate the link with the outcomes, patient survival and length of hospital stay. Three hundred patients, who received 359 OLTs, were retrospectively analyzed. ARI and ARF occurred post 11.1 and 25.7\% of OLTs, respectively. By multivariate analysis, ARI was associated with pre-OLT hypertension and alcoholic liver disease and ARF with higher pre-OLT creatinine, inotrope and aminoglycoside use. ARF, but not ARI, had an impact on 30-day and 1-year patient survival and longer length of hospital stay. ARI and ARF, as defined by the RIFLE criteria, are common complications of OLT, with distinct risk factors and ARF has serious clinical consequences. The development of a consensus definition is a welcome advance, however these criteria do need to be validated in large studies in a wide variety of patient populations.},

Methods PlGF testing was performed in addition to routine clinical assessment in 260 women {$>$}20 weeks’ gestation with chronic disease (hypertension, renal disease ± diabetes) with a change in maternal condition or in women with suspected FGR to determine the impact on clinical management. Results were revealed and standardised care pathways followed. Main outcome measures Outcome of pregnancies with a low PlGF ({$<$}12 pg/ml and 13–100 pg/ml), impact on clinical service and the diagnostic accuracy of alternative PlGF cut-offs. Results 206/260 (79.2\%) women had an adverse outcome (PE/birthweight {$<$} 10th centile/preterm birth). In our cohort, a low PlGF ({$<$}12 pg/ml) was associated with a shorter test-birth interval and universally (100\% PPV) with an adverse pregnancy outcome, although 29/61 (47.5\%) of women with PlGF {$<$} 12 pg/ml continued their pregnancy {$>$}14 days. The PlGF result altered clinical management (surveillance or timing of birth) in 196/260 (75.4\%) cases. Alternative PlGF thresholds did not significantly improve diagnostic performance. Conclusions Our evaluation confirms the value of PlGF as a diagnostic tool for placental dysfunction. However, low PlGF in isolation should not trigger iatrogenic delivery. Further research linking placental pathology, maternal disease and maternal PlGF levels is urgently needed before this test can be implemented in routine clinical practice.},

The algorithms were validated on manually labeled data. Sensitivities and specifities of 94\% and 97\% were achieved for the ECG and 91\% and 95\% for the PPG. Additionally, we propose two applications of the SQI. First, we demostrate that, by using the SQI as a trigger for a power saving strategy, it is possible to reduce the recording time by up to 94\% for the ECG and 93\% for the PPG with only minimal loss of valid vital-sign data. Second, we demonstrate how an SQI can be used to reduce the error in the estimation of respiratory rate (RR) from the PPG. The performance of the two applications was assessed on the data collected from a clinical study on hospital patients who were able to walk unassisted.},

The new biology is essentially the result of shifts in the way biological research has progressed over the past few years, mainly through the involvement of physical scientists and engineers in biological thinking and research with the establishment of new teams and task forces to address the new challenges in biology. Their contributions go well beyond the historical contributions of mathematics, physical sciences, and engineering to medical practice that were largely equipment oriented. Over the next generation, the entire fabric of the biosciences will change as research barriers between disciplines diminish and eventually cease to exist. The resulting effects are starting to be noticed in front-line medicine and the prospects for the future are immense and potentially society changing. The most likely disciplines to have early effects are outlined and form the main thrust of this paper, with speculation about other disciplines and emphasis that although physics-based and engineering-based biology will change future medicine, the physical sciences and engineering will also be changed by these developments. Essentially, physics is being redefined by the need to accommodate these new views of what constitutes biological systems and how they function.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, but is currently under-diagnosed since it can be asymptomatic. Early detection of AF could be highly beneficial for the prevention of stroke, which is one major risk associated with AF, with a five fold increase. mHealth applications have been recently proposed for early screening of paroxysmal AF. Several automatic AF detections have been suggested, and they are mostly based on features extracted from the RR interval time-series, since this is more robust to ambulatory noise than p-wave based algorithms. The RR interval features highlight the irregularity and unpredictability of the rhythm due to the chaotic electrical conduction through the AV node. Such approach has proved to be accurate on openly available databases. However, current techniques are limited by their assumption of almost perfect R peak detection, and RR time-series features are usually estimated from manual annotations. Analysis of the huge amount of data an mHealth application may create has to be automated, robust to noise, and should incorporate a confidence index based on an estimation of the signal quality. In this study, we present an in depth analysis of the performance of AF detection algorithms as a function of noise and QRS detection performance. We show a linear decrease of AF detection accuracy with respect to the SNR. Finally, we will demonstrate how the use of an automatic signal quality index can ensure a given level of performance in AF detection, more than 95\% AF detection accuracy by analyzing segments with a median SQI over 0.8.},

  abstract = {Objectives:  To apply the RIFLE criteria “risk,” “injury,” and “failure” for severity of acute kidney injury to patients admitted to the intensive care unit and to evaluate the significance of other prognostic factors. Design: Retrospective analysis of the Riyadh Intensive Care Program database. Setting: Riyadh Intensive Care Unit Program database of 41,972 patients admitted to 22 intensive care units in the United Kingdom and Germany between 1989 and 1999. Patients: Acute kidney injury as defined by the RIFLE classification occurred in 15,019 (35.8\%) patients; 7,207 (17.2\%) patients were at risk, 4,613 (11\%) had injury, and 3,199 (7.6\%) had failure. It was found that 797 (2.3\%) patients had end-stage dialysis-dependent renal failure when admitted to an intensive care unit. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Patients with risk, injury, and failure classifications had hospital mortality rates of 20.9\%, 45.6\%, and 56.8\%, respectively, compared with 8.4\% among patients without acute kidney injury. Independent risk factors for hospital mortality were age (odds ratio 1.02); Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score on admission to intensive care unit (odds ratio 1.10); presence of preexisting end-stage disease (odds ratio 1.17); mechanical ventilation (odds ratio 1.52); RIFLE categories risk (odds ratio 1.40), injury (odds ratio 1.96), and failure (odds ratio 1.59); maximum number of failed organs (odds ratio 2.13); admission after emergency surgery (odds ratio 3.08); and nonsurgical admission (odds ratio 3.92). Renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury was not an independent risk factor for hospital mortality. Conclusions: The RIFLE classification was suitable for the definition of acute kidney injury in intensive care units. There was an association between acute kidney injury and hospital outcome, but associated organ failure, nonsurgical admission, and admission after emergency surgery had a greater impact on prognosis than severity of acute kidney injury.},

  abstract = {Microsaccades are known to occur during prolonged visual fixation, but it is a matter of controversy whether they also happen during free-viewing. Here we set out to determine: 1) whether microsaccades occur during free visual exploration and visual search, 2) whether microsaccade dynamics vary as a function of visual stimulation and viewing task, and 3) whether saccades and microsaccades share characteristics that might argue in favor of a common saccade-microsaccade oculomotor generator. Human subjects viewed naturalistic stimuli while performing various viewing tasks, including visual exploration, visual search, and prolonged visual fixation. Their eye movements were simultaneously recorded with high precision. Our results show that microsaccades are produced during the fixation periods that occur during visual exploration and visual search. Microsaccade dynamics during free-viewing moreover varied as a function of visual stimulation and viewing task, with increasingly demanding tasks resulting in increased microsaccade production. Moreover, saccades and microsaccades had comparable spatiotemporal characteristics, including the presence of equivalent refractory periods between all pair-wise combinations of saccades and microsaccades. Thus our results indicate a microsaccade-saccade continuum and support the hypothesis of a common oculomotor generator for saccades and microsaccades.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To implement routine in-house monitoring of risk-adjusted 30-day mortality following paediatric cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Collaborative monitoring software development and implementation in three specialist centres. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analyses incorporated 2 years of data routinely audited by the National Institute of Cardiac Outcomes Research (NICOR). Exclusion criteria were patients over 16 or undergoing non-cardiac or only catheter procedures. We applied the partial risk adjustment in surgery (PRAiS) risk model for death within 30 days following surgery and generated variable life-adjusted display (VLAD) charts for each centre. These were shared with each clinical team and feedback was sought. RESULTS: Participating centres were Great Ormond Street Hospital, Evelina Children's Hospital and The Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. Data captured all procedures performed between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2011. This incorporated 2490 30-day episodes of care, 66 of which were associated with a death within 30 days.The VLAD charts generated for each centre displayed trends in outcomes benchmarked to recent national outcomes. All centres ended the 2-year period within four deaths from what would be expected. The VLAD charts were shared in multidisciplinary meetings and clinical teams reported that they were a useful addition to existing quality assurance initiatives. Each centre is continuing to use the prototype software to monitor their in-house surgical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Timely and routine monitoring of risk-adjusted mortality following paediatric cardiac surgery is feasible. Close liaison with hospital data managers as well as clinicians was crucial to the success of the project.},

  abstract = {Precision cut liver slices (PCLSs) retain the structure and cellular composition of the native liver and represent an improved system to study liver fibrosis compared to two-dimensional mono- or co-cultures. The aim of this study was to develop a bioreactor system to increase the healthy life span of PCLSs and model fibrogenesis. PCLSs were generated from normal rat or human liver, or fibrotic rat liver, and cultured in our bioreactor. PCLS function was quantified by albumin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fibrosis was induced in PCLSs by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF?1) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF??) stimulation~±~therapy. Fibrosis was assessed by gene expression, picrosirius red, and α-smooth muscle actin staining, hydroxyproline assay, and soluble ELISAs. Bioreactor-cultured PCLSs are viable, maintaining tissue structure, metabolic activity, and stable albumin secretion for up to 6 days under normoxic culture conditions. Conversely, standard static transwell-cultured PCLSs rapidly deteriorate, and albumin secretion is significantly impaired by 48 hours. TGF?1/PDGF?? stimulation of rat or human PCLSs induced fibrogenic gene expression, release of extracellular matrix proteins, activation of hepatic myofibroblasts, and histological fibrosis. Fibrogenesis slowly progresses over 6 days in cultured fibrotic rat PCLSs without exogenous challenge. Activin receptor-like kinase 5 (Alk5) inhibitor (Alk5i), nintedanib, and obeticholic acid therapy limited fibrogenesis in TGF?1/PDGF??-stimulated PCLSs, and Alk5i blunted progression of fibrosis in fibrotic PCLS. Conclusion: We describe a bioreactor technology that maintains functional PCLS cultures for 6 days. Bioreactor-cultured PCLSs can be successfully used to model fibrogenesis and demonstrate efficacy of antifibrotic therapies.},

Human eye movements were recorded while participants viewed a series of digitized images of complex natural and artificial scenes. Stimulus dependence of attention, as measured by the correlation between computed stimulus salience and fixation locations, was found to be significantly greater than that expected by chance alone and furthermore was greatest for eye movements that immediately follow stimulus onset. The ability to guide attention of three modeled stimulus features (color, intensity and orientation) was examined and found to vary with image type. Additionally, the effect of the drop in visual sensitivity as a function of eccentricity on stimulus salience was examined, modeled, and shown to be an important determiner of attentional allocation. Overall, the results indicate that stimulus-driven, bottom-up mechanisms contribute significantly to attentional guidance under natural viewing conditions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Reproducibility was not significantly different between cine and spin-echo MR imaging. Intraobserver, interobserver, and interexamination errors were quantitated with variance component analysis. Interexamination variability was the single most important contributor to total variance. Reproducibility of left ventricular chamber volume measurements with MR imaging is superior to that of other imaging modalities. In addition, MR imaging can provide reliable estimates of wall mass and wall stress. Efforts to improve reproducibility should be aimed at lowering interexamination variability.},

  abstract = {Non-invasive coronary artery imaging has taken a significant step forward with the advent of multislice computed tomography Non-invasive coronary imaging has recently seen a rapid expansion of interest, fuelled largely by technical advances in both computed tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). The race is on for these two modalities to provide routine and robust imaging of coronary arteries in clinical practice.The rate of this progress has inevitably provided a bewildering array of developments, which are hard to stay abreast of. This article will attempt to clarify the fundamental differences between the available techniques, explore their respective capabilities, and discuss future potentials. EBCT has been the CT method of choice for imaging the heart for the last 10 years or more. Unlike conventional CT, which uses a rotating x ray tube, EBCT uses a static row of detectors and a moving beam of electrons to produce the x ray photons. The advantage of this is a rapid image acquisition time of 50–100 ms per slice. When combined with ECG triggering this allows imaging of a motion free heart during diastole (usually 80\% of the RR interval).1 This technique has been used to quantify coronary calcium burden and more recently to perform contrast enhanced coronary angiography.2,3 The disadvantages of EBCT are the poor signal-to-noise ratio and increased slice thickness compared with conventional CT, the lack of general availability of EBCT, and the radiation dose compared to CMR. Also known as multidetector CT, these scanners are a development from single slice helical (or spiral) CT. A single rotating x ray tube provides a beam of photons that is then received by several rows of detectors (usually four), effectively giving four axial slices for each tube rotation. There are now scanners available that allow eight or 16 …},

Design: Retrospective cohort study using data from an electronic register. A statistical model was used to estimate the effect on survival of placing public access defibrillators at suitable or possibly suitable sites. Setting: Scottish Ambulance Service. Subjects: Records of all out of hospital cardiac arrests due to heart disease in Scotland in 1991-8. Main outcome measures: Observed and predicted survival to discharge from hospital. Results: Of 15 189 arrests, 12 004 (79.0\%) occurred in sites not suitable for the location of public access defibrillators, 453 (3.0\%) in sites where they may be suitable, and 2732 (18.0\%) in suitable sites. Defibrillation was given in 67.9\% of arrests that occurred in possibly suitable sites for locating defibrillators and in 72.9\% of arrests that occurred in suitable sites. Compared with an actual overall survival of 744 (5.0\%), the predicted survival with public access defibrillators ranged from 942 (6.3\%) to 959 (6.5\%), depending on the assumptions made regarding defibrillator coverage. Conclusions: The predicted increase in survival from targeted provision of public access defibrillators is less than the increase achievable through expansion of first responder defibrillation to non-ambulance personnel, such as police or firefighters, or of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Additional resources for wide scale coverage of public access defibrillators are probably not justified by the marginal improvement in survival.},

  abstract = {Introduction Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is a bothersome condition affecting older men which can lead to poor quality of life. General practitioners (GPs) currently have no easily available assessment tools to help effectively diagnose causes of LUTS and aid discussion of treatment with patients. Men are frequently referred to urology specialists who often recommend treatments that could have been initiated in primary care. GP access to simple, accurate tests and clinician decision tools are needed to facilitate accurate and effective patient management of LUTS in primary care.Methods and analysis PRImary care Management of lower Urinary tract Symptoms (PriMUS) is a prospective diagnostic accuracy study based in primary care. The study will determine which of a number of index tests used in combination best predict three urodynamic observations in men who present to their GP with LUTS. These are detrusor overactivity, bladder outlet obstruction and/or detrusor underactivity. Two cohorts of participants, one for development of the prototype diagnostic tool and other for validation, will undergo a series of simple index tests and the invasive reference standard (invasive urodynamics). We will develop and validate three diagnostic prediction models based on each condition and then combine them with management recommendations to form a clinical decision support tool.Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is from the Wales Research Ethics Committee 6. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and results will be of interest to professional and patient stakeholders.Trial registration number ISRCTN10327305.},

There is broad agreement that healthcare professionals working on the front lines benefit greatly from the visual display of data presented in time order.Aim To describe the run chart—an analytical tool commonly used by professionals in quality improvement but underutilised in healthcare.Methods A standard approach to the construction, use and interpretation of run charts for healthcare applications is developed based on the statistical process control literature.Discussion Run charts allow us to understand objectively if the changes we make to a process or system over time lead to improvements and do so with minimal mathematical complexity. This method of analyzing and reporting data is of greater value to improvement projects and teams than traditional aggregate summary statistics that ignore time order. Because of its utility and simplicity, the run chart has wide potential application in healthcare for practitioners and decision-makers. Run charts also provide the foundation for more sophisticated methods of analysis and learning such as Shewhart (control) charts and planned experimentation.},

IVCCM was performed in both eyes and corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), branch density (CNBD), and fiber length (CNFL) and the tortuosity coefficient were quantified. RESULTS: All corneal nerve parameters differed significantly between diabetic patients and control subjects and progressively worsened with increasing severity of neuropathy. The reduction in CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL was symmetrical in all groups except in patients with severe neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: IVCCM noninvasively detects corneal nerve loss, which relates to the severity of neuropathy, and is symmetrical, except in those with severe diabetic neuropathy.},

  abstract = {Abstract Aim To assess the usefulness of monthly thermography and standard foot care to reduce diabetic foot ulcer recurrence. Methods People with diabetes (n~=~110), neuropathy and history of~≥~1 foot ulcer participated in a single-blind multicentre clinical trial. Feet were imaged with a novel thermal imaging device (Diabetic Foot Ulcer Prevention System). Participants were randomized to intervention (active thermography + standard foot care) or control (blinded thermography + standard foot care) and were followed up monthly until ulcer recurrence or for 12~months. Foot thermograms of participants from the intervention group were assessed for hot spots (areas with temperature~≥~2.2°C higher than the corresponding contralateral site) and acted upon as per local standards. Results After 12~months, 62\% of participants were ulcer-free in the intervention group and 56\% in the control group. The odds ratios of ulcer recurrence (intervention vs control) were 0.82 (95\% CI 0.38, 1.8; P~=~0.62) and 0.55 (95\% CI 0.21, 1.4; P~=~0.22) in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, respectively. The hazard ratios for the time to ulcer recurrence (intervention vs control) were 0.84 (95\% CI 0.45, 1.6; P~=~0.58) and 0.67 (95\% CI 0.34, 1.3; P~=~0.24) in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, respectively. Conclusions Monthly intervention with thermal imaging did not result in a significant reduction in ulcer recurrence rate or increased ulcer-free survival in this cohort at high risk of foot ulcers. This trial has, however, informed the design of a refined study with longer follow-up and group stratification, further aiming to assess the efficacy of thermography to reduce ulcer recurrence.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify relative and absolute changes in mortality in the Northern region of England between 1981 and 1991. DESIGN: 1981 and 1991 census data were used to rank 678 wards on an index of material deprivation composed of four variables (unemployment, car ownership, housing tenure, household overcrowding). Standardised mortality ratios (all causes) were calculated for various periods between 1981 and 1991 and for different age categories. SETTING: Counties of Cleveland, Cumbria, Durham, Northumberland, and Tyne and Wear. RESULTS: During 1981-91 mortality differentials widened between the most affluent and deprived fifths of wards in all age categories under 75 years. The decline in the relative position of the poorest areas was particularly great, and there was no narrowing of inequalities across the remainder of the socioeconomic spectrum. In absolute terms, there were improvements in mortality in all age categories in the most affluent areas. In the poorest areas improvements in the 55-64 age group were balanced by increased mortality among men aged 15-44, a slight rise among women aged 65-74, and static rates among men aged 45-54. CONCLUSIONS: These results re-emphasise the case for linking mortality patterns with material conditions rather than individual behaviour.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess the prevalence of peripheral artery disease and the validity of clinical signs for its diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods Setting: Health center (Mariñamansa, Orense). Period January 2011–January 2013. Inclusion criteria Patients with type 2 diabetes, informed consent. Measurements Age, sex, diabetes duration, body mass index, Charlson index, blood pressure, ankle-brachial index (ABI), cholesterol levels, smoking. Cardiovascular risk (UKPDS). Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire. Sample size n=323 (±5.5\% accuracy, 95\% confidence). Statistical analysis: multivariate logistic regression analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and agreement were estimated. Informed consent and ethics committee approval were obtained (2010/278). Results Mean patient age was 71.56±12.73 years, and mean diabetes duration 12.38±9.96 years. Symptoms of intermittent claudication were reported by 26.4\% of patients, ABI was normal (0.9–1.1) in 37.2\% of patients, less than 0.9 in 26.5\%, and higher than 1.10 in 36.2\% of patients. The kappa index of agreement of peripheral artery disease according to the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire and the ankle-brachial index was 0.33. The questionnaire showed a sensitivity of 50.7\% for predicting the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease (ABI{$<$}0.9) with a specificity of 82.6\%, with positive and negative predictive values of 48.6\% and 83.8\% respectively. Conclusions One-fourth of patients with type 2 diabetes had peripheral artery disease. There was a low level of agreement between the evaluation of symptoms of intermittent claudication and the results of the ankle-brachial index. Presence or absence of symptoms of claudication did not allow for confirming or ruling out peripheral artery disease. Resumen Objetivo Determinar en pacientes diabéticos tipo 2 la prevalencia de arteriopatía periférica y la validez de las manifestaciones clínicas para su diagnóstico. Métodos Ámbito: Centro de Salud (Mariñamansa, Orense). Periodo Enero de 2011 - enero de 2013. Criterios inclusión Pacientes diabéticos tipo 2, con consentimiento informado. Mediciones Edad, sexo, tiempo de evolución de diabetes, índice de masa corporal, índice de Charlson, presión arterial, índice tobillo-brazo, niveles de colesterol, hábito tabáquico. Riesgo cardiovascular (UKPDS). Cuestionario de Edimburgo. Tamaño muestral: n=323 (±5,5\% precisión; 95\% seguridad). Análisis estadístico Análisis multivariado de regresión logística. Estudio de sensibilidad, especificidad valores predictivos y concordancia. Aprobado por el Comité Ético de Investigación (2010/278). Resultados La edad media fue de 71,56±12,73 años, la media de evolución de la diabetes tipo 2 fue de 12,38±9,96 años. El 26,4\% referían síntomas de claudicación intermitente. El 37,2\% presentaban un índice tobillo-brazo normal (ITB 0,9-1,1), un 26,5\%{$<$}0,9 y un 36,2\%{$>$}1,10. La concordancia de la arteriopatía periférica según el cuestionario de Edimburgo y el ITB fue reducida (índice Kappa=0,33). El cuestionario de Edimburgo mostró una sensibilidad del 50,7\% para predecir el diagnóstico de arteriopatía periférica (ITB{$<$} 0,9) una especificidad del 82,6\%, un valor predictivo positivo y negativo de 48,6 y 83,8\% respectivamente. Conclusiones Una cuarta parte de los pacientes diabéticos tipo 2 presenta arteriopatía periférica. Existe una baja concordancia entre la evaluación de síntomas de claudicación intermitente y los resultados del ITB. La presencia de los síntomas de claudicación o su ausencia no permiten descartar ni confirmar la enfermedad arterial periférica.},

Hemodialysis (HD) is seldom used in neonates and infants due to the risk of major complications in the very young. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data on all infants younger than 12 months with ESRD who received HD in our Pediatric Dialysis Unit between January 1997 and June 2013 were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen infants (n = 6 male) with ESRD (median age 3 months; median weight 4.06 kg) received HD through a central venous catheter (CVC) for a total of 543 months (median duration per infant 16 months). Seven of the infants (39 \%) were neonates, and five (28 \%) had serious comorbidities. There were five episodes of CVC infection, which is a rate of 0.3/1000 CVC days. Median catheter survival time was 320 days. Most infants had good oral intake, and only four (22 \%) required a gastric tube; 14 (78 \%) infants displayed normal growth. Fourteen (78 \%) infants had hypertension, of whom four (22 \%) had severe cardiac complications; eight (44 \%) showed delayed psychomotor development. Eleven (61 \%) of the infants, including six (86 \%) of the neonates, survived. Five (28 \%) infants underwent renal transplantation; 10-year graft survival was 80 \%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, long-term HD in neonates and infants with ESRD is technically feasible, can be implemented without major complications, carries a very low rate of CVC infection and malfunction, and results in adequate nutrition, good growth, as well as good kidney graft and patient survivals. Future efforts should aim to prevent hypertension and its cardiac sequelae, improve neurodevelopmental outcome, and lower mortality rate in these infants.},

  abstract = {Objective To examine the efficacy of different methods of detecting a high death rate and determining whether an increase in deaths after heart transplantation could be explained by chance. Design Retrospective analysis of deaths after heart transplantation. Seven methods were used: mortality above national average, mortality excessively above national average, test of moving average mortality, test of number of consecutive deaths, sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), cusum graph with v-mask, and CRAM chart. The national average mortality was not available and a rate of 15\% was used instead as the benchmark. Setting Regional cardiothoracic unit. Participants All 371 patients who received a heart transplant in the programme, 1986-2000. Main outcome measures 30 day survival after transplantation. Results All methods provided evidence that the 30 day mortality had been high at some stage. The probability that the finding was a false positive depended on which test was used. At the end of the series the average mortality, sequential probability ratio, and cusum tests indicated a level of deaths higher than the benchmark while the remaining four tests yielded negative results. Conclusions If the decision to test for outlying mortality is made retrospectively, in the light of the data, it is not possible to determine the false positive rate. Prospective on-site mortality monitoring with the CRAM chart is recommended as this method can quantify the death rate and identify periods when an audit of cases is indicated, even when data from other institutions are not available. A hospital mortality monitoring group can routinely monitor all deaths in the hospital, by specialty, using hospital episode statistics (HES) data and appropriate statistical methods.},

  abstract = {Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a semi-invasive, monitoring and diagnostic tool, which is used in the perioperative management of cardiac surgical and hemodynamically unstable patients. The low degree of invasiveness and the capacity to visualize and assimilate dynamic information that can change the course of the patient management is an important advantage of TEE. Although TEE is reliable, comprehensive, credible, and cost-effective, it must be performed by a trained echocardiographer who understands the indications and the potential complications of the procedure, and has the ability to achieve proper acquisition and interpretation of the echocardiographic data. Adequate knowledge of the physics of ultrasound and the TEE machine controls is imperative to optimize image quality, reduce artifacts, and prevent misinterpretation of diagnosis. Two-dimensional (2D) and Motion (M) mode imaging are used for obtaining anatomical information, while Doppler and Color Flow imaging are used for information on blood flow. 3D technology enables us to view the cardiac structures from different perspectives. Despite the recent advances of 3D TEE, a sharp, optimized 2D image is pivotal for the reconstruction. This article describes the relevant underlying physical principles of ultrasound and focuses on a systematic approach to instrumentation and use of controls in the practical use of transesophageal echocardiography.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inguinal hemia repair is one of the most common operations undertaken in routine surgical practice. It generally carries a very low risk of major adverse sequelae. We analysed profiles, separately, for elective and emergency operations to report on the incidence and major adverse outcomes of inguinal hernia repair in a geographically defined population. METHODS: Age- and sex-specific hospital admission rates, emergency readmission rates within 30 days of discharge, and mortality rates, separately for elective and emergency operations, were calculated for the period 1976-1986 in the Oxford Record Linkage Study (ORLS) area. RESULTS: In all, 30,675 inguinal hernia repairs were performed in the area, an all-ages annual incidence of 13 per 10,000 population. Some 9\% of patients underwent operation in an emergency admission. Elective operation rates remained constant over time. Emergency repairs decreased significantly over time in males. Patients who underwent emergency repair were older, had higher emergency readmission rates than those undergoing elective repair, and had significantly elevated postoperative mortality rates. In those who died it was uncommon for inguinal hernia to be recorded on their death certificates. Of the operations, 91\% were undertaken on males; age-specific rates were highest in infants and the elderly; and emergency operation rates rose exponentially with age in people \textbackslash textgreater 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: The lifetime 'risk' of inguinal hernia repair is high: at currently prevailing rates we estimate it at 27\% for men and 3\% for women. There is significant elevation of mortality after emergency operations. Elective repair of inguinal hernia should be undertaken soon after the diagnosis is made to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes.},

EuroSCORE I 20.0\%) between August 2010 and July 2013. We present the 1-year outcome in this MitraClip cohort—which is the largest published to date.Seven forty-nine patients (90.5\%) were available for 1-year follow-up and included in the following analyses. Mortality, major adverse cardiovascular event rates, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes were recorded. Predictors of 1-year mortality were identified by multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model with stepwise forward selection. The 1-year mortality was 20.3\%. At 1 year, 63.3\% of TRAMI patients pertained to NYHA functional classes I or II (compared with 11.0\% at baseline), and self-rated health status (on EuroQuol visual analogue scale) also improved significantly by 10 points. Importantly, a significant proportion of patients regained the complete independence in self-care after MitraClip implantation (independence in 74.0 vs. 58.6\% at baseline, P = 0.005). Predictors of 1-year mortality were NYHA class IV (hazard ratio, HR 1.62, P = 0.02), anaemia (HR 2.44, P = 0.02), previous aortic valve intervention (HR 2.12, P = 0.002), serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL (HR 1.77, P = 0.002), peripheral artery disease (HR 2.12, P = 0.0003), left ventricular ejection fraction \&lt;30\% (HR 1.58, P = 0.01), severe tricuspid regurgitation (HR 1.84, P = 0.003), and procedural failure (defined as operator-reported failure, conversion to surgery, failure of clip placement, or residual post-procedural severe mitral regurgitation) (HR 4.36, P \&lt; 0.0001).Treatment of significant MR with MitraClip resulted in significant clinical improvements in a high proportion of TRAMI patients after 12 months. In the TRAMI cohort, the failure of procedural success exhibited the highest hazard ratio concerning the prediction of 1-year mortality.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In an interrupted time series (ITS) design, data are collected at multiple instances over time before and after an intervention to detect whether the intervention has an effect significantly greater than the underlying secular trend. We critically reviewed the methodological quality of ITS designs using studies included in two systematic reviews (a review of mass media interventions and a review of guideline dissemination and implementation strategies). METHODS: Quality criteria were developed, and data were abstracted from each study. If the primary study analyzed the ITS design inappropriately, we reanalyzed the results by using time series regression. RESULTS: Twenty mass media studies and thirty-eight guideline studies were included. A total of 66\% of ITS studies did not rule out the threat that another event could have occurred at the point of intervention. Thirty-three studies were reanalyzed, of which eight had significant preintervention trends. All of the studies were considered "effective" in the original report, but approximately half of the reanalyzed studies showed no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that ITS designs are often analyzed inappropriately, underpowered, and poorly reported in implementation research. We have illustrated a framework for appraising ITS designs, and more widespread adoption of this framework would strengthen reviews that use ITS designs.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the principles of blood pressure measurement with automated oscillometric devices (e.g., Dinamap) allows a user to realize the purpose and level of accuracy for which the equipment is designed. Good technique calls for various actions: (1) using a cuff of proper size (too large a cuff will generally work acceptably, but too small a cuff will yield erroneously high readings); (2) squeezing all of the residual air out of the cuff before applying it to the arm or leg; (3) wrapping the cuff snugly around the arm or leg; (4) instructing the patient to refrain from talking or moving and letting nothing press against the cuff during measurement; (5) keeping the cuff and heart at the same horizontal level. (6) When instrument malfunction is suspected, first checking the status of the patient (not the status of the instrument) to be sure that a clinical emergency is not causing the suspected “malfunction”; (7) repeating a reading several times when it is suspicious and, if necessary, modifying the measurement conditions by using, for example, different limbs or different cuffs until the question is resolved; and (8) remembering that a leak in the cuff, hoses, or connection can cause an unexpected malfunction.},

  abstract = {Background: We aimed to prospectively validate a novel 1-hour algorithm using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T measurement for early rule-out and rule-in of acute myocardial infarction (MI).Methods: In a multicentre study, we enrolled 1320 patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute MI. The high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T 1-hour algorithm, incorporating baseline values as well as absolute changes within the first hour, was validated against the final diagnosis. The final diagnosis was then adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including coronary angiography, echocardiography, follow-up data and serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels.Results: Acute MI was the final diagnosis in 17.3\% of patients. With application of the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T 1-hour algorithm, 786 (59.5\%) patients were classified as “rule-out,” 216 (16.4\%) were classified as “rule-in” and 318 (24.1\%) were classified to the “observational zone.” The sensitivity and the negative predictive value for acute MI in the rule-out zone were 99.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 97.6\%–99.9\%) and 99.9\% (95\% CI 99.3\%–100\%), respectively. The specificity and the positive predictive value for acute MI in the rule-in zone were 95.7\% (95\% CI 94.3\%–96.8\%) and 78.2\% (95\% CI 72.1\%–83.6\%), respectively. The 1-hour algorithm provided higher negative and positive predictive values than the standard interpretation of highsensitivity cardiac troponin T using a single cut-off level (both p \&lt; 0.05). Cumulative 30-day mortality was 0.0\%, 1.6\% and 1.9\% in patients classified in the rule-out, observational and rule-in groups, respectively (p = 0.001).Interpretation: This rapid strategy incorporating high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T baseline values and absolute changes within the first hour substantially accelerated the management of suspected acute MI by allowing safe rule-out as well as accurate rule-in of acute MI in 3 out of 4 patients.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the trend in hospital admission rates for heart failure in the Netherlands from 1980 to 1993. DESIGN: All hospital admissions in the Netherlands with a principal discharge diagnosis of heart failure were analysed. In addition, individual records of heart failure patients from a subset of 7 hospitals were analysed to estimate the frequency and timing of readmissions. RESULTS: The total number of discharges for men increased from 7377 in 1980 to 13 022 in 1993, and for women from 7064 to 12 944. From 1980 through 1993 age adjusted discharge rates rose 48\% for men and 40\% for women. Age adjusted in-hospital mortality for heart failure decreased from 19\% in 1980 to 15\% in 1993. For all age groups in-hospital mortality for men was higher than for women. The mean length of hospital admissions in 1993 was 14.0 days for men and 16.4 days for women. A review of individual patient records from a 6.3\% sample of all hospital admissions in the Netherlands indicated that within a 2 year period 18\% of the heart failure patients were admitted more than once and 5\% more than twice. CONCLUSIONS: For both men and women a pronounced increase in age adjusted discharge rates for heart failure was observed in the Netherlands from 1980 to 1993. Readmissions were a prominent feature among heart failure patients. Higher survival rates after acute myocardial infarction and the longer survival of patients with heart disease, including heart failure may have contributed to the observed increase. The importance of advances in diagnostic tools and of possible changes in admission policy remain uncertain.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the long-term results of the iliac artery stent placement for the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication. From November 1988 to December 1998, 303 legs were treated with metal stents in 259 patients with iliac occlusive arterial disease in a follow-up study approved by the institutional review board. Stenoses (n = 162) were treated after failed angioplasty and occlusions (n = 141) were treated with primary stent placement. According to Fontaine's clinical classification of chronic ischemia, 266 (88\%) legs presented stage IIB, 14 (5\%) stage III, and 23 (7\%) stage IV. In all legs, self-expandable stents (Wallstent) were implanted. The patients were followed up with clinical examination, ankle brachial- index examination measurement and intravenous angiography. The data were analyzed using the univariate analysis (Kaplan-Meier method) and multivariate analysis (Cox proportional model). The primary endpoint of the study was the identification of restenosis or reoclusion of the stenting arterial segment and a secondary endpoint that was an identification of the risk factors of restenosis and reoclusion. The mean +/- SD ankle-brachial index pre-, post-procedure, and in the last control was 0.58 +/- 0.18, 0.90 +/- 0.23, and 0.86 +/- 0.24, respectively. Primary cumulative patency rates were 70\% +/- 4 after 5 years, and 65\% +/- 5 after 7 years, and secondary patency rates were 92\% +/- 2 after 5 years, and 87\% +/- 4 after 9 years. Immediate complications in the first 24 hours appeared in 12 (4\%) legs, thrombosis in 5 legs, 3 legs presented with distal embolism, 2 thrombi at the access site and pseudo aneurysm and artery rupture in 1 leg. A patient died in the first 24 hours. Within 30 days after the procedure seven complications, 3 thromboses and 4 stenosis appeared. During follow-up, 42 (16\%) patients died of other causes. The main causes of death were cardiac disease (39\%), cerebrovascular disease (15\%), cancer (7\%), respiratory diseases (4\%), and death due to accidents (2\%), and other causes (9\%). In 24\% of the cases there was insufficient information to assign a principal cause of death. Thirty-six patients (13\%) were lost to follow-up. Complications arose in 54 (18\%) legs due to occlusion of the treated segment (29\%), and stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia (27\%). Thirteen patients required surgical treatment. Primary and secondary patency mean time was 80 +/- 3.7 and 102 +/- 2.4 months, respectively. We found no significant relation between patency and the quality of run-off, but a small vessel diameter and the female gender were negative predictive factors for failure (proportional hazards model). The use of stents for treatment of iliac artery occlusive disease may be considered an effective method with a low complication rate and acceptable long-term follow-up results.},

  abstract = {Background- Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to improve survival compared with standard therapy in patients with severe aortic stenosis who cannot have surgery. The effects of TAVR on health-related quality of life have not been reported from a controlled study. Methods and Results- The Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) trial randomized patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis who were not candidates for surgical valve replacement to TAVR (n=179) or standard therapy (n=179). Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline and at 1, 6, and 12 months with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the 12-item Short Form-12 General Health Survey (SF-12). The primary end point was the KCCQ overall summary score (range, 0-100; higher=better). At baseline, mean KCCQ summary scores (35±20) and SF-12 physical summary scores (28±7) were markedly depressed. Although the KCCQ summary score improved from baseline in both groups, the extent of improvement was greater after TAVR compared with control at 1 month (mean between-group difference, 13 points; 95\% confidence interval, 8-19; P\textbackslash textless0.001) with larger benefits at 6 months (mean difference, 21 points; 95\% confidence interval, 15-27; P\textbackslash textless0.001) and 12 months (mean difference, 26 points; 95\% confidence interval, 19-33; P\textbackslash textless0.001). At 12 months, TAVR patients also reported higher SF-12 physical and mental health scores with mean differences compared with standard care of 5.7 and 6.4 points, respectively (P\textbackslash textless0.001 for both comparisons). Conclusions- Among inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis, compared with standard care, TAVR resulted in significant improvements in health-related quality of life that were maintained for at least 1 year.

  abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to compare health status and quality-of-life outcomes for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and high surgical risk treated with either transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Background: For high-risk patients with severe AS, TAVR has been shown to result in similar 12-month survival but differing adverse events compared with AVR. Methods: We evaluated the health status of 628 patients with severe, symptomatic AS at high risk of surgical complications who were randomized to either TAVR or AVR in the PARTNER Trial. Health status was assessed at baseline and 1, 6, and 12 months using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, the Short Form-12, and the EuroQol-5D. Results: The primary outcome, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score, improved more rapidly with TAVR, but was similar for the 2 groups at 6 and 12 months. However, there was a significant interaction between the benefit of TAVR and access site (transapical vs. transfemoral). Patients eligible for transfemoral TAVR demonstrated significant health status benefits with TAVR versus AVR at 1 month (difference, 9.9 points; 95\% confidence interval: 4.9 to 14.9; p \textbackslash textless 0.001), whereas patients treated via the TA approach demonstrated no benefits with TAVR compared with AVR at any time point. Results for Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire subscales and generic measures demonstrated similar patterns. Conclusions: In high-risk patients with severe AS, health status improved substantially between baseline and 1 year after either TAVR or AVR. TAVR via the transfemoral, but not the transapical route, was associated with a short-term advantage compared with surgery.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: From a young age the typical development of social functioning relies upon the allocation of attention to socially relevant information, which in turn allows experience at processing such information and thus enhances social cognition. As such, research has attempted to identify the developmental processes that are derailed in some neuro-developmental disorders that impact upon social functioning. Williams syndrome (WS) and autism are disorders of development that are characterized by atypical yet divergent social phenotypes and atypicalities of attention to people.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS: We used eye tracking to explore how individuals with WS and autism attended to, and subsequently interpreted, an actor's eye gaze cue within a social scene. Images were presented for 3 seconds, initially with an instruction simply to look at the picture. The images were then shown again, with the participant asked to identify the object being looked at. Allocation of eye gaze in each condition was analyzed by analysis of variance and accuracy of identification was compared with t tests.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: Participants with WS allocated more gaze time to face and eyes than their matched controls, both with and without being asked to identify the item being looked at; while participants with autism spent less time on face and eyes in both conditions. When cued to follow gaze, participants with WS increased gaze to the correct targets; those with autism looked more at the face and eyes but did not increase gaze to the correct targets, while continuing to look much more than their controls at implausible targets. Both groups identified fewer objects than their controls.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: The atypicalities found are likely to be entwined with the deficits shown in interpreting social cognitive cues from the images. WS and autism are characterized by atypicalities of social attention that impact upon socio-cognitive expertise, but, importantly, the type of atypicality is syndrome specific.},

This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there is a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes.The SPIRIT-AI extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI. Both guidelines were developed using a staged consensus process, involving a literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted on by an international multi-stakeholder group in a 2-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed on in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants).The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items, which were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations around the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases.SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer-reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.}

  abstract = {Enhanced perception of detail has long been regarded a hallmark of autism spectrum conditions (ASC), but its origins are unknown. Normal sensitivity on all fundamental perceptual measures-visual acuity, contrast discrimination, and flicker detection-is strongly established in the literature. If individuals with ASC do not have superior low-level vision, how is perception of detail enhanced? We argue that this apparent paradox can be resolved by considering visual attention, which is known to enhance basic visual sensitivity, resulting in greater acuity and lower contrast thresholds. Here, we demonstrate that the focus of attention and concomitant enhancement of perception are sharper in human individuals with ASC than in matched controls. Using a simple visual acuity task embedded in a standard cueing paradigm, we mapped the spatial and temporal gradients of attentional enhancement by varying the distance and onset time of visual targets relative to an exogenous cue, which obligatorily captures attention. Individuals with ASC demonstrated a greater fall-off in performance with distance from the cue than controls, indicating a sharper spatial gradient of attention. Further, this sharpness was highly correlated with the severity of autistic symptoms in ASC, as well as autistic traits across both ASC and control groups. These findings establish the presence of a form of "tunnel vision" in ASC, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of the social and neurobiological aspects of autism.},

The ciliated outgrowth image is digitized and the variation in optical density is automatically calculated for each selected area of interest. 32 measurements of ciliary beat frequency are, in this way, calculated simultaneously in 6 min. With this reliable device, some studies on baseline frequency of control culture have been carried out. There was no variation in the mean frequencies of ciliated cells of the primary culture of different tracheas in our culture conditions. Moreover, the values of ciliary beat frequency at the starting point of the outgrowth were similar to those at the periphery of the outgrowth. There is nevertheless a slow decrease in frequencies versus the duration of culture. We have also established that the frequency of ciliary beat of some cells fluctuates in a periodic pattern whereas the majority of the ciliated population beat in a stable way. The image analysis process allows us to perform a cartography of frequencies on the video display. It also allows us to have access to the frequency of one cilium. Our method therefore seems to be reliable and furthermore simple in the evaluation of the potential effect of inhaled toxic compounds on ciliated cells of mammalian respiratory tract.},

AKI in critically ill children is typically associated with multiple organ dysfunction. A dramatic increase in the incidence of AKI in pediatric intensive care units has been observed in the last 10 years. Unfortunately, the absence of sufficiently effective preventive and therapeutic measures at the present time has limited significant improvements in AKI care. Morality in patients with severe AKI remains unacceptably high (\textbackslash textgreater50 \%), with renal replacement therapy (RRT) remaining the most effective form of support for these patients. Despite technological advances during the last 10 years which have resulted in the development of the so-called "third-generation dialysis machines" that are characterized by the highest level of safety and accuracy, a truly pedriatric RRT system has never been developed. Consequently, dialysis/hemofiltration in critically ill children is currently performed by adapting adult systems to the much smaller pediatric patients. In particular, research in this field should focus on children weighing less than 10 kg for whom the delivery of RRT is a clinical and technological challenge. We describe here the evolution of pediatric RRT during the last 30 years and report in detail on the CARPEDIEM project, which has recently been established to finally provide neonates and infants with a reliable dialysis machine that is specifically designed for this age group.},

  abstract = {To evaluate quality of care, a two-step approach seems appropriate. First, highly-structured explicit criteria, based on patient outcomes such as mortality, readmissions, or unusually long lengths of hospital stay, might help identify adverse events using routinely-collected discharge data. Then, process criteria might be used for subsequent medical record reviews to determine whether a quality problem exists. Large administrative data bases suggest the possibility of developing an epidemiology of quality of care; understanding how quality problems are distributed across the hospitals in a province seems feasible. Population-wide data are essential for comprehensive follow-up and for effective studies of medical practices. Hospital-based follow-up can miss important events; we found the relative percentage of short-term readmissions to hospitals other than the hospital of surgery startling. However, hospital-based data can sometimes be used in place of the more costly and harder-to-generate population data for quality monitoring. For example, in examining correlations among various outcome indicators following five common surgical procedures, we found the ranking of hospitals according to inhospital mortality to be highly correlated with their ranking according to 30-day post-surgical mortality.},

  abstract = {Decisions about the adoption of medical interventions are informed by evidence on their costs and effects. For a range of reasons, evidence relating to medical devices may be limited. The decision to adopt a device early in its life cycle when the evidence base is least mature may impact on the prospects of acquiring further evidence to reduce uncertainties. Equally, rejecting a device will result in no uptake in practice and hence no chance to learn about performance. Decision options such as ‘only in research' or ‘approval with research' can overcome these issues by allowing patients early access to promising new technologies while limiting the risks associated with making incorrect decisions until more evidence or learning is established. In this paper, we set out the issues relating to uncertainty and the value of research specific to devices: learning curve effects, incremental device innovation, investment and irrecoverable costs, and dynamic pricing. We show the circumstances under which an only in research or approval with research scheme may be an appropriate policy choice. We also consider how the value of additional research might be shared between the manufacturer and health sector to help inform who might reasonably be expected to conduct the research needed. © 2017 The Authors.

  abstract = {Background. Tracheal intubation is a potentially life-saving procedure. This skill is taught to many anesthetic healthcare professionals, including nurse anesthetists. Our goal was to evaluate the learning ability of nurse anesthetist trainees in their performance of orotracheal intubation with the Macintosh laryngoscope. Methods. Eleven nurse anesthetist trainees were enrolled in the study during the first three months of their training. All trainees attended formal lectures and practice sessions with manikins at least one time on performing successful tracheal intubation under supervision of anesthesiology staff. Learning curves for each nurse anesthetist trainee were constructed with the standard cumulative summation (cusum) methods. Results. Tracheal intubation was attempted on 388 patients. Three hundred and six patients (78.9\%) were successfully intubated on the trainees' first attempt and 17 patients (4.4\%) on the second attempt. The mean ± SD number of orotracheal intubations per trainee was 35.5 ± 5.1 (range 30-47). Ten (90.9\%) of 11 trainees crossed the 20\% acceptable failure rate line. A median of 22 procedures was required to achieve an 80\% orotracheal intubations success rate. Conclusion. At least 22 procedures were required to reach an 80\% success rate for orotracheal intubation using Macintosh laryngoscope in nonexperienced nurse anesthetist trainees.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In some diagnostic accuracy studies, the test results of a series of patients with an established diagnosis are compared with those of a control group. Such case-control designs are intuitively appealing, but they have also been criticized for leading to inflated estimates of accuracy. METHODS: We discuss similarities and differences between diagnostic and etiologic case-control studies, as well as the mechanisms that can lead to variation in estimates of diagnostic accuracy in studies with separate sampling schemes ("gates") for diseased (cases) and nondiseased individuals (controls). RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy studies are cross-sectional and descriptive in nature. Etiologic case-control studies aim to quantify the effect of potential causal exposures on disease occurrence, which inherently involves a time window between exposure and disease occurrence. Researchers and readers should be aware of spectrum effects in diagnostic case-control studies as a result of the restricted sampling of cases and/or controls, which can lead to changes in estimates of diagnostic accuracy. These spectrum effects may be advantageous in the early investigation of a new diagnostic test, but for an overall evaluation of the clinical performance of a test, case-control studies should closely mimic cross-sectional diagnostic studies. CONCLUSIONS: As the accuracy of a test is likely to vary across subgroups of patients, researchers and clinicians might carefully consider the potential for spectrum effects in all designs and analyses, particularly in diagnostic accuracy studies with differential sampling schemes for diseased (cases) and nondiseased individuals (controls).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of death or severe harm due to bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS) among patients undergoing hip hemiarthroplasty for fractured neck of femur. SETTING: Hospitals providing secondary and tertiary care throughout the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS: Cases reported to the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) in which the reporter clearly describes severe acute patient deterioration associated with cement use in hip hemiarthroplasty for fractured neck of femur (assessed independently by two reviewers). OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary-number of reported deaths, cardiac arrests and periarrests per year. Secondary-timing of deterioration and outcome in relation to cement insertion. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2012, the NRLS received 62 reports that clearly describe death or severe harm associated with the use of cement in hip hemiarthroplasty for fractured neck of femur. There was one such incident for every 2900 hemiarthroplasties for fractured neck of femur during the period. Of the 62 reports, 41 patients died, 14 were resuscitated from cardiac arrest and 7 from periarrest. Most reports (55/62, 89\%) describe acute deterioration occurring during or within a few minutes of cement insertion. The vast majority of deaths (33/41, 80\%) occurred on the operating table. CONCLUSIONS: These reports provide narrative evidence from England and Wales that cement use in hip hemiarthroplasty for fractured neck of femur is associated with instances of perioperative death or severe harm consistent with BCIS. In 2009, the National Patient Safety Agency publicised this issue and encouraged the use of mitigation measures. Three-quarters of the deaths in this study have occurred since that alert, suggesting incomplete implementation or effectiveness of those mitigation measures. There is a need for stronger evidence that weighs the risks and benefits of cement in hip hemiarthroplasty for fractured neck of femur.},

About 36/55 (65\%) who continued beyond month 1 reported \textbackslash textgreater1 adverse event. At month 3 mean PVT worsened in Group A (RT (7.65\%, P\textbackslash textless0.001), NL (43.3\%, P=0.005)) and mean PW worsened in all groups (A 28.0\%, P=0.01, B 21.2\%, P=0.03, C 12.8\%, P\textbackslash textless0.05). No other clinically significant safety signal was detected. Cysts reduced/resolved in the OCT subfield of maximal pathology in 67\% Group C eyes. Thinning was greater at 3 and 4 months for greater baseline thickness (central subfield P\textbackslash textless0.001, maximal P\textbackslash textless0.05).ConclusionSleep masks showed no major safety signal apart from a small impairment of daytime alertness and a moderate effect on wellbeing. Masks were acceptable apart from in some healthy participants. Preliminary data suggest a beneficial effect on retinal thickness in DMO.

  abstract = {Systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies are fundamental to the decision making process in evidence based medicine. Although such studies are regarded as high level evidence, these reviews are not always reported completely and transparently. Suboptimal reporting of DTA systematic reviews compromises their validity and generalisability, and subsequently their value to key stakeholders. An extension of the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis) statement was recently developed to improve the reporting quality of DTA systematic reviews. The PRISMA-DTA statement has 27 items, of which eight are unmodified from the original PRISMA statement. This article provides an explanation for the 19 new and modified items, along with their meaning and rationale. Examples of complete reporting are used for each item to illustrate best practices.The understanding of diagnostic test performance can be enhanced through diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic reviews. When performed following rigorous methodology, systematic reviews can improve our understanding of a specific intervention or diagnostic test.123 However, published systematic reviews, including DTA reviews, are often insufficiently informative and therefore of limited use.456 Incomplete reporting of systematic reviews prevents stakeholders who rely on health research from critically assessing the quality of evidence and could lead to patient harm, misallocation of resources, and research waste.789An extension of the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis) statement was recently developed to facilitate complete and transparent reporting of DTA systematic reviews, along with another PRISMA extension for abstracts.101112 The PRISMA-DTA statement includes 27 items; eight of the 27 original PRISMA items were unmodified, 17 original items were modified, two new items were added, and another two were omitted.This article is modelled after similar explanation and elaboration documents for other reporting guidelines.13 …}

  abstract = {A computer algorithm that performs at or above the level of radiologists in mammography screening assessment could improve the effectiveness of breast cancer screening.To perform an external evaluation of 3 commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided detection algorithms as independent mammography readers and to assess the screening performance when combined with radiologists.This retrospective case-control study was based on a double-reader population-based mammography screening cohort of women screened at an academic hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, from 2008 to 2015. The study included 8805 women aged 40 to 74 years who underwent mammography screening and who did not have implants or prior breast cancer. The study sample included 739 women who were diagnosed as having breast cancer (positive) and a random sample of 8066 healthy controls (negative for breast cancer).Positive follow-up findings were determined by pathology-verified diagnosis at screening or within 12 months thereafter. Negative follow-up findings were determined by a 2-year cancer-free follow-up. Three AI computer-aided detection algorithms (AI-1, AI-2, and AI-3), sourced from different vendors, yielded a continuous score for the suspicion of cancer in each mammography examination. For a decision of normal or abnormal, the cut point was defined by the mean specificity of the first-reader radiologists (96.6\%).The median age of study participants was 60 years (interquartile range, 50-66 years) for 739 women who received a diagnosis of breast cancer and 54 years (interquartile range, 47-63 years) for 8066 healthy controls. The cases positive for cancer comprised 618 (84\%) screen detected and 121 (16\%) clinically detected within 12 months of the screening examination. The area under the receiver operating curve for cancer detection was 0.956 (95\% CI, 0.948-0.965) for AI-1, 0.922 (95\% CI, 0.910-0.934) for AI-2, and 0.920 (95\% CI, 0.909-0.931) for AI-3. At the specificity of the radiologists, the sensitivities were 81.9\% for AI-1, 67.0\% for AI-2, 67.4\% for AI-3, 77.4\% for first-reader radiologist, and 80.1\% for second-reader radiologist. Combining AI-1 with first-reader radiologists achieved 88.6\% sensitivity at 93.0\% specificity (abnormal defined by either of the 2 making an abnormal assessment). No other examined combination of AI algorithms and radiologists surpassed this sensitivity level.To our knowledge, this study is the first independent evaluation of several AI computer-aided detection algorithms for screening mammography. The results of this study indicated that a commercially available AI computer-aided detection algorithm can assess screening mammograms with a sufficient diagnostic performance to be further evaluated as an independent reader in prospective clinical trials. Combining the first readers with the best algorithm identified more cases positive for cancer than combining the first readers with second readers.},

  abstract = {The digitalization of the health-care system has resulted in a deluge of clinical big data and has prompted the rapid growth of data science in medicine. Data science, which is the field of study dedicated to the principled extraction of knowledge from complex data, is particularly relevant in the critical care setting. The availability of large amounts of data in the ICU, the need for better evidence-based care, and the complexity of critical illness makes the use of data science techniques and data-driven research particularly appealing to intensivists. Despite the increasing number of studies and publications in the field, thus far there have been few examples of data science projects that have resulted in successful implementations of data-driven systems in the ICU. However, given the expected growth in the field, intensivists should be familiar with the opportunities and challenges of big data and data science. The present article reviews the definitions, types of algorithms, applications, challenges, and future of big data and data science in critical care.},

The main aim of this study is to validate the RRP-adapted Distress Thermometer and Problem List (DT\&PL). STUDY DESIGN Prospective cross-sectional questionnaire research. SETTING Academic tertiary care medical centers in Groningen, Netherlands, and Helsinki, Finland. METHODS AND SUBJECTS Ninety-one juvenile- and adult-onset RRP patients participated from the departments of otorhinolaryngology-head and neck surgery of the University Medical Center Groningen, Netherlands, and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used as the gold standard. RESULTS A DT cutoff score ≥4 gave the best sensitivity and specificity. Thirty-one percent of patients had significant distress according to the DT cutoff. Significantly more patients with a score above than under the cutoff had a referral wish. The PL appeared to be reliable. Patients' opinions on the DT\&PL were largely favorable. CONCLUSION The Dutch and Finnish versions of the DT\&PL are valid, reliable screening tools for distress in RRP patients.},

In this study, we compared attention to social scenes in 15 high-functioning individuals with autism (ASD) and matched typically developing (TD) individuals. Eye-tracking was recorded while participants were presented with pairs of scenes, either emotional positive-neutral, emotional negative-neutral or neutral-neutral scenes. Early allocation of attention, the first image fixated in each pair, differed between groups: contrary to TD individuals who showed the typical threat-detection advantage towards negative images, the ASD group failed to show a bias toward threat-related scenes. Later processing of stimuli, indicated by the total fixation to the images during the 3-s presentation, was found unaffected in the ASD group. These results support the hypothesis of an early atypical allocation of attention towards natural social scenes in ASD, that is compensated in later stages of visual processing.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The influence of CD34+ cell dose on the outcome of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) remains controversial. The impact of the number of CD34+ hematoprogenitors infused on transplant outcome and on the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) was analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 138 patients with advanced hematological diseases who received an allogeneic PBSC transplant after RIC were analyzed. Donors were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and underwent one to three apheresis procedures. Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and overall and event-free survival (OS and EFS) was determined. RESULTS: The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 5.57 × 10(6) kg(-1) (range: 1.1-15.6). There was no relationship between CD34+ cell dose and neutrophil or platelet engraftment. Patients receiving ≥5 × 10(6) kg(-1) CD34+ cells had a 63.1\% 5-year OS when compared with 48.2\% for those receiving a lower number (P = 0.024). At 5-year follow-up, there was no significant difference in EFS between the groups (44\% vs. 42.8\%, P = 0.426). No relationship between CD34+ cell dose and acute GVHD was found (P = 0.1). Relapse rate was the same in patients with and without acute GVHD (P = 0.117). A nonsignificant improvement on OS and EFS in patients who developed chronic GVHD was found (P = 0.57 and 0.41). CONCLUSION: A CD34+ cell dose ≥5 × 10(6) kg(-1) was associated with a significantly higher OS, but no improved EFS in high-risk patients. The number of CD34+ progenitors infused had no influence on the incidence of acute or chronic GVHD. J. Clin. Apheresis, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Context : Prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is increasingly used in prostate cancer diagnosis. The reported negative predictive value (NPV) of mpMRI is used by some clinicians to aid in decision making about whether or not to proceed to biopsy. Objective : We aim to perform a contemporary systematic review that reflects the latest literature on optimal mpMRI techniques and scoring systems to update the NPV of mpMRI for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Evidence acquisition : We conducted a systematic literature search and included studies from 2016 to September 4, 2019, which assessed the NPV of mpMRI for csPCa, using biopsy or clinical follow-up as the reference standard. To ensure that studies included in this analysis reflect contemporary practice, we only included studies in which mpMRI findings were interpreted according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) or similar Likert grading system. We define negative mpMRI as either (1) PIRADS/Likert 1–2 or (2) PIRADS/Likert 1–3; csPCa was defined as either (1) Gleason grade group ≥2 or (2) Gleason grade group ≥3. We calculated NPV separately for each combination of negative mpMRI and csPCa. Evidence synthesis : A total of 42 studies with 7321 patients met our inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. Using definition (1) for negative mpMRI and csPCa, the pooled NPV for biopsy-naïve men was 90.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 88.1–93.1\%). When defining csPCa using definition (2), the NPV for csPCa was 97.1\% (95\% CI 94.9–98.7\%). Calculation of the pooled NPV using definition (2) for negative mpMRI and definition (1) for csPCa yielded the following: 86.8\% (95\% CI 80.1–92.4\%). Using definition (2) for both negative mpMRI and csPCa, the pooled NPV from two studies was 96.1\% (95\% CI 93.4–98.2\%). Conclusions : Multiparametric MRI of the prostate is generally an accurate test for ruling out csPCa. However, we observed heterogeneity in the NPV estimates, and local institutional data should form the basis of decision making if available. Patient summary : The negative predictive values should assist in decision making for clinicians considering not proceeding to biopsy in men with elevated age-specific prostate-specific antigen and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging reported as negative (or equivocal) on Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System/Likert scoring. Some 7–10\% of men, depending on the setting, will miss a diagnosis of clinically significant cancer if they do not proceed to biopsy. Given the institutional variation in results, it is of upmost importance to base decision making on local data if available.},

The use of multivariable risk prediction tools can significantly reduce unnecessary systematic biopsies, without compromising the detection of clinically significant disease. Increasingly multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed, not only in men with a persistent suspicion of prostate cancer after prior negative systematic biopsy, but also at initial screening before the first biopsy. The combination of MRI and multivariate risk prediction tools could potentially enhance prostate cancer diagnosis using multivariate MRI incorporated risk-based models to decide on the need for prostate MRI, but also using MRI results to adjusted risk-based models, and to guide MRI-directed biopsies. In this review, we discuss the diagnostic work-up for clinically significant prostate cancer, where the combination of MRI and multivariate risk prediction tools is integrated, and how together they can contribute to personalized diagnosis.},

Hence, if several features are evaluated on a limited data set over‐optimistic results are easily achieved. In order to find features that separate different outcome classes of interest, statistical evaluation of the nuclear features must be performed. Furthermore, to classify an unknown sample using image analysis, a classification rule must be designed and evaluated. Unfortunately, statistical evaluation methods used in the literature of nuclear image analysis are often inappropriate. The present article discusses some of the difficulties in statistical evaluation of nuclear image analysis, and a study of cervical cancer is presented in order to illustrate the problems. In conclusion, some of the most severe errors in nuclear image analysis occur in analysis of a large feature set, including few patients, without confirming the results on an independent data set. To select features, Bonferroni correction for multiple test is recommended, together with a standard feature set selection method. Furthermore, we consider that the minimum requirement of performing statistical evaluation in nuclear image analysis is confirmation of the results on an independent data set. We suggest that a consensus of how to perform evaluation of diagnostic and prognostic features is necessary, in order to develop reliable tools for clinical use, based on nuclear image analysis.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate results in 110 patients who had iliac arterial occlusive disease and were treated with stents before 1991. Materials and methods: From 1987 to 1990, 110 patients (mean age, 57 years) with iliac arterial occlusive disease (Fontaine stage IIa, seven patients; IIb, 95 patients; III, four patients; IV, four patients) underwent implantation of a self-expanding metal stent. Stenoses (n=66) were treated after failed angioplasty, and occlusions (n=60) were treated with primary stent placement. Follow-up included angiography and/or color duplex ultrasonography and clinical examination with ankle-brachial index measurement. Patients lost to follow-up were interviewed by using dedicated questionnaires administered by telephone and/or mail. If a patient was deceased, relatives and attending doctors were interviewed. Results: The fate of 109 of the 110 patients was determined. Overall, 46 patients died: 18 within 5 years, 39 within 10 years, and seven after more than 10 years. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 83\% and 64\%, respectively. Cardiovascular disease caused 23 deaths; malignant tumor caused 15. The cause of death remained unknown in five patients. Primary stent patency rates were 66\%+/-4.8 (standard error) after 5 years and 46\%+/-5.9 after 10 years; secondary patency rates were 79\%+/-4.2 after 5 years and 55\%+/-6.3 after 10 years (Kaplan-Meier test). Seventeen (16\%) patients underwent surgical bypass of the aortoiliac arteries that involved the segment with the stent, 14 because of stent restenosis and three because of stenosis in other iliac arterial segments. Conclusion: The main cause of death in patients with intermittent claudication was cardiac disease. Long-term patency of iliac arterial stents was moderate.. (C) RSNA, 2002.},

Patients from newborn to ten years of age requiring tracheal intubation for elective surgery were studied. The endotracheal tube size was calculated using the formula: (age + 16) divided by 4 for patients \textbackslash textgreater or = two years of age and at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist for patients \textbackslash textless two years of age. After the induction of anaesthesia and administration of a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, the patient's trachea was intubated and mid-tracheal placement was confirmed. Two of the three staff anaesthetists participating in the study assessed the leak pressure consecutively. Each participant performed a single leak determination. The leak pressure was determined as follows: the patient was supine with the head in a neutral position, fresh gas flowed into the breathing circuit at 5 L.min-1, a stethoscope was placed on the skin over the larynx and the pressure relief valve was completely closed. Pressure slowly increased in the breathing circuit until an audible leak occurred around the tracheal tube. The inter-observer difference was calculated in 212 patients. The absolute value of the difference between that of two observers increased as the mean leak pressure increased. However, the variation between observers expressed as a percent of the absolute measurement remained constant. An average variance in measurement of 38\% was found at both low and high leak pressures. In conclusion, we found considerable variation between two experienced observers in assessing leak pressures.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The accuracy of current formulae for the sonographic estimation of fetal weight (EFW) is compromised by significant intra- and interobserver variability of biometrical measurements, particularly circumferences. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of the linear measurement of mid-thigh soft-tissue thickness (STT) and to derive a novel formula for EFW. METHODS: This was a prospective study involving 388 singleton uncomplicated pregnancies. There were three consecutive phases: (1) to verify the relationship between STT and birth weight, (2) to derive a novel formula for EFW using femur length and STT only, and (3) to test the accuracy of the new equation. Only the 290 patients who delivered within 48 h of measurement were considered for the analysis. A comparison with other formulae was performed. RESULTS: STT was significantly correlated with both abdominal circumference and birth weight (r(2) = 0.36 and 0.46, respectively; P \textbackslash textless 0.001). Both intra- and interobserver variability were satisfactory (0.44 +/- 0.27 and 0.57 +/- 0.35 mm, respectively). The equation for EFW was developed using multiple stepwise regression analysis (EFW = - 1687.47 + (54.1 x femur length) + (76.68 x STT)) and tested prospectively on 69 patients. The new formula yielded results (r = 0.79) that were slightly better in accuracy than two other published equations, and had an absolute mean error of \textbackslash textless 15\% in 97\% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the potential of the linear measurement of mid-thigh STT as a valuable parameter for the sonographic assessment of fetal growth and EFW. Our new equation is apparently at least as reliable as the most widely used formulae for EFW.},

  abstract = {Patent foramen ovale is being increasingly linked to a number of pathological conditions, most recently the prevalent disorder of migraine with aura. Many experts now no longer regard PFO as a harmless pimple but more a peril to health and even longevity In 1877, Cohnheim first indicated a causal relation between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and relevant sickness when analysing the case of a young woman with a stroke.1 Since then, PFO has been recognised as a potential conduit for paradoxical embolism of thrombus, fat, air, or “things” as harmless as desaturated blood leading to various ailments, such as cerebral ischaemia,2 transient global amnesia, decompression illness in divers,3 refractory hypoxemia in the presence of right ventricular infarction or severe pulmonary disease, and the rare platypnoea–orthodeoxia syndrome. PFO has even been recently linked to the prevalent disorder of migraine with aura,4,5 and now many experts no longer regard it as a harmless pimple but as a peril to health and even longevity. Thus, the drastic statement can be envisaged that any hole, maybe except for valvar gaps and ventricular or coronary lumens, should be closed as soon as it is detected. Aside from debating the latter mentioned visions, the main goal of this article is to provide a practical overview of how a PFO can be identified best. In contrast to the notion of an abridged life after birth due to an open foramen ovale, the negative effect of a closed foramen ovale before birth is not speculative. The function of the foramen ovale before birth is that well oxygenated blood from the inferior vena cava bypasses the not yet operational pulmonary circulation. In this context, the Eustachian valve causes the blood to stream towards the foramen ovale and directly into the left atrium. During and …},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many patients with AKI are cared for by non-nephrologists. This can result in variable standards of care that contribute to poor outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: To improve AKI recognition, a real-time, hospital-wide, electronic reporting system was designed based on current Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria. This system allowed prospective data collection on AKI incidence and outcomes such as mortality rate, length of hospital stay, and renal recovery. The setting was a 1139-bed teaching hospital with a tertiary referral nephrology unit. RESULTS: An electronic reporting system was successfully introduced into clinical practice (false positive rate, 1.7\%; false negative rate, 0.2\%). The results showed that there were 3202 AKI episodes in 2619 patients during the 9-month study period (5.4\% of hospital admissions). The in-hospital mortality rate was 23.8\% and increased with more severe AKI (16.1\% for stage 1 AKI versus 36.1\% for stage 3) (P\textbackslash textless0.001). More severe AKI was associated with longer length of hospital stay for stage 1 (8 days; interquartile range, 13) versus 11 days for stage 3 (interquartile range, 16) (P\textbackslash textless0.001) and reduced chance of renal recovery (80.0\% in stage 1 AKI versus 58.8\% in stage 3) (P\textbackslash textless0.001). Utility of the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria was reduced in those with pre-existing CKD. CONCLUSIONS: AKI is common in hospitalized patients and is associated with very poor outcomes. The successful implementation of electronic alert systems to aid early recognition of AKI across all acute specialties is one strategy that may help raise standards of care.},

Wald-type test statistics have been proposed for testing sensitivity and specificity individually. In the presence of a gold standard, simultaneous comparison between two diagnostic tests for noninferiority of sensitivity and specificity based on an asymptotic approach has been studied by Chen et al. (2003). However, the asymptotic approach may suffer from unsatisfactory type I error control as observed from many studies, especially in small to medium sample settings. In this paper, we compare three unconditional approaches for simultaneously testing sensitivity and specificity. They are approaches based on estimation, maximization, and a combination of estimation and maximization. Although the estimation approach does not guarantee type I error, it has satisfactory performance with regard to type I error control. The other two unconditional approaches are exact. The approach based on estimation and maximization is generally more powerful than the approach based on maximization.}

  abstract = {Objectives Placental Growth Factor (PlGF) has been shown to be beneficial in diagnosing pre-eclampsia. We performed a prospective cohort study of revealed PlGF in standard clinical use in four teaching hospitals in UK, Germany, Austria and Australia. Study design Clinical data from women with suspected pre-eclampsia or fetal growth restriction {$<$}35 weeks’ gestation with revealed PlGF measurement were collected (MAPPLE study). Main outcome measures Data were compared to the PELICAN study (PlGF concealed). Pre-specified outcomes were compared using standard statistical tests (median difference or Risk Ratio). The results were further categorised by PlGF concentration: i) very low ({$<$}12 pg/ml), ii) low (12–100 pg/ml), iii) normal ({$>$}100 pg/ml). Results 396 women managed with revealed PlGF (MAPPLE) were compared with 287 women with concealed PlGF (PELICAN). Revealed PlGF led to delivery 1.4 weeks earlier (−2.0 to −0.9, 34.9 weeks vs 36.7 weeks). There were no significant differences in maternal adverse outcomes (11.9\% vs 10.1\%, Risk Ratio (RR) 1.17, 95\% CI 0.76–1.82) or caesarean sections (73.8\% vs 64.5\%; RR 1.14, 95\% CI 1.03–1.26). Revealed PlGF led to fewer perinatal deaths (2 vs 9; RR 0.16, 95\% CI 0.03–0.74) and fewer babies with birthweight {$<$}3rd centile (28.9\% vs 36.1\%; RR 0.80, 0.65–0.99), but with more neonatal adverse outcomes (30.4\% vs 17.1\%; RR 1.78, 95\% CI 1.32–2.41). Conclusions Revealed PlGF may be associated with lower perinatal mortality and birthweight {$<$}3rd centile but appears to lead to earlier delivery with more neonatal respiratory morbidity. Randomised trials with adequate power for clinical outcomes are needed. Funding Financial assistance was received from Alere to support the running of the MAPPLE database.

OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that titrating corticosteroid dose using the concentration of exhaled nitric oxide in exhaled breath (Fe(NO)) results in fewer asthma exacerbations and more efficient use of corticosteroids, when compared with traditional management. METHODS: One hundred eighteen participants with a primary care diagnosis of asthma were randomized to a single-blind trial of corticosteroid therapy based on either Fe(NO) measurements (n = 58) or British Thoracic Society guidelines (n = 60). Participants were assessed monthly for 4 months and then every 2 months for a further 8 months. The primary outcome was the number of severe asthma exacerbations. Analyses were by intention to treat. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The estimated mean (SD) exacerbation frequency was 0.33 per patient per year (0.69) in the Fe(NO) group and 0.42 (0.79) in the control group (mean difference, -21\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -57 to 43\%; p = 0.43). Overall the Fe(NO) group used 11\% more inhaled corticosteroid (95\% CI, -17 to 42\%; p = 0.40), although the final daily dose of inhaled corticosteroid was lower in the Fe(NO) group (557 vs. 895 microg; mean difference, 338 microg; 95\% CI, -640 to -37; p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: An asthma treatment strategy based on the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide did not result in a large reduction in asthma exacerbations or in the total amount of inhaled corticosteroid therapy used over 12 mo, when compared with current asthma guidelines.

  abstract = {To compensate for neural delays, organisms require predictive motor control. We investigated the transition between reaction and prediction in saccades (rapid eye movements) to periodically paced targets. Tracking at low frequencies (0.2-0.3 Hz) is reactive (eyes lag target) and at high frequencies (0.9-1.0 Hz) is predictive (eyes anticipate target); there is an abrupt rather than smooth transition between the two modes (a "phase transition," as found in bistable physical systems). These behaviors represent stable modes of the oculomotor control system, with attendant rapid switching between the neural pathways underlying the different modes. Furthermore, predictive saccades exhibit long-term correlations (slow decay of the autocorrelation function, manifest as a 1/f alpha spectrum). This indicates that predictive trials are not independent. The findings have implications for the understanding of predictive motor control: predictive performance during a given trial is influenced by a feedback process that takes into account the latency of previous trials.},

  abstract = {Two of the most challenging areas in antenatal care are prematurity and pre-eclampsia. Between them they affect one in 10 of all pregnant women, and their prevalence is static. Until recently management options have been limited. Improved understanding of the basic pathophysiology is changing this. This article describes those advances that have made an impact on the management of prematurity and pre-eclampsia. Another major concern in obstetrics is the rising number of interventions, particularly caesarean sections, without obvious benefit to mother or baby. Recent research has highlighted several simple but effective strategies that could help influence this trend. These include management of previous caesarean sections and breech presentation and more appropriate use of fetal monitoring and epidurals in labour; knowledge of these will be valuable to any clinician who comes into contact with pregnant women. The articles selected are from relevant searches in English from Pubmed and the Cochrane Collaboration, as well as the author's own experience through research and reviewing. The current structure of antenatal care developed around detecting pre-eclampsia. The detection of hypertension and proteinuria, the defining signs of this syndrome, is the key aim of frequent surveillance in pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia occurs in about 3\% of pregnant women and results in around 100 000 maternal deaths per year worldwide. The fetus is also affected, directly through placental insufficiency and indirectly through iatrogenic delivery; this accounts for 25\% of all infants with a very low birth weight (\&lt; 1500 g). The onset and course of pre-eclampsia are unpredictable, and it therefore results in enormous use of health resources. Accurate prediction and targeted preventive measures would have enormous benefit. Prediction Many biochemical substances, principally of placental and endothelial origin, increase in pre-eclampsia. However, their predictive value to detect susceptible women before clinical presentation is poor. As the disorder originates in the …},

  abstract = {Objective: To develop a guideline document model that includes a sufficiently broad set of concepts to be useful throughout the guideline life cycle.Design: Current guideline document models are limited in that they reflect the specific orientation of the stakeholder who created them; thus, developers and disseminators often provide few constructs for conceptualizing recommendations, while implementers de-emphasize concepts related to establishing guideline validity. The authors developed the Guideline Elements Model (GEM) using XML to better represent the heterogeneous knowledge contained in practice guidelines. Core constructs were derived from the Institute of Medicine's Guideline Appraisal Instrument, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, and the augmented decision table guideline representation. These were supplemented by additional concepts from a literature review.Results: The GEM hierarchy includes more than 100 elements. Major concepts relate to a guideline's identity, developer, purpose, intended audience, method of development, target population, knowledge components, testing, and review plan. Knowledge components in guideline documents include recommendations (which in turn comprise conditionals and imperatives), definitions, and algorithms.Conclusion: GEM is more comprehensive than existing models and is expressively adequate to represent the heterogeneous information contained in guidelines. Use of XML contributes to a flexible, comprehensible, shareable, and reusable knowledge representation that is both readable by human beings and processible by computers.},

The impact of the number of CD34+ hematoprogenitors infused on transplant outcome and on the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) was analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 138 patients with advanced hematological diseases who received an allogeneic PBSC transplant after RIC were analyzed. Donors were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and underwent one to three apheresis procedures. Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and overall and event-free survival (OS and EFS) was determined. RESULTS: The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 5.57 × 10(6) kg(-1) (range: 1.1-15.6). There was no relationship between CD34+ cell dose and neutrophil or platelet engraftment. Patients receiving ≥5 × 10(6) kg(-1) CD34+ cells had a 63.1\% 5-year OS when compared with 48.2\% for those receiving a lower number (P = 0.024). At 5-year follow-up, there was no significant difference in EFS between the groups (44\% vs. 42.8\%, P = 0.426). No relationship between CD34+ cell dose and acute GVHD was found (P = 0.1). Relapse rate was the same in patients with and without acute GVHD (P = 0.117). A nonsignificant improvement on OS and EFS in patients who developed chronic GVHD was found (P = 0.57 and 0.41). CONCLUSION: A CD34+ cell dose ≥5 × 10(6) kg(-1) was associated with a significantly higher OS, but no improved EFS in high-risk patients. The number of CD34+ progenitors infused had no influence on the incidence of acute or chronic GVHD. J. Clin. Apheresis, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Most hospital computer systems are essentially for administration, and there have been relatively few successful clinical systems,7-9 with nephrology10 and intensive care medicine11 having progressed furthest.We describe a successful clinical system in nephrology based on an underlying flexible “generic” software package that can work in any specialty. The system is explained by reference to a general model of patient care. Summary points The proper foundation for healthcare computing should be clinical information systems based on the individual patient An underlying generic software package has been developed which can be adapted to any specialty Such a system can facilitate many aspects of clinical management, clinical administration, and general management With such systems, paperless operation is possible The care of each patient can be considered to be a control loop (fig 1),12 in which data from observations and investigations lead to decisions and actions designed to take care of a patient's problems and their consequences in a safe, effective, and legitimate manner. This loop occurs in all specialties and is the source of all the activities of a healthcare facility such as a hospital.

Despite this finding, to date, there have been no quantitative evaluations of the accuracy of predictions made by these systems. We report a study evaluating the accuracy of predictions made by the main United Kingdom early warning system. METHODS: As prediction of impact is analogous to diagnosis, a method normally applied to determine the accuracy of diagnostic tests was used. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the National Horizon Scanning Centre's prediction methods were estimated with reference to an (imperfect) gold standard, that is, expert opinion of impact 3 to 5 years after prediction. RESULTS: The sensitivity of predictions was 71 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.92), and the specificity was 73 percent (95 percent CI, 0.64-0.8). The negative predictive value was 98 percent (95 percent CI, 0.92-0.99), and the positive predictive value was 14 percent (95 percent CI, 0.06-0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Forecasting is difficult, but the results suggest that this early warning system's predictions have an acceptable level of accuracy. However, there are caveats. The first is that early warning systems may themselves reduce the impact of a technology, as helping to control adoption and diffusion is their main purpose. The second is that the use of an imperfect gold standard may bias the results. As early warning systems are viewed as an increasingly important component of health technology assessment and decision making, their outcomes must be evaluated. The method used here should be investigated further and the accuracy of other early warning systems explored.},

  abstract = {Computer simulation techniques using codes such as NASCAP have proved very successful in tackling the spacecraft charging problem. Although a full dynamic three-dimensional code is required to model a spacecraft in orbit, simpler codes (e.g. MATCHG) can do much to clarify the interaction between the environment and a surface. It is difficult to obtain complete data on either the incident particle fluxes or the material properties which determine the various current components. The latter are dependent upon particle energy which is in turn a function of surface potential; therefore the resulting equilibrium and the charging time to attain this potential are controlled by a long list of input parameters. In order to assess the sensitivity of a solution to each of these inputs, a simple code (EQUIPOT) is used to calculate the net current as surface potential ois stepped from zero to that required for equilibrium (Jnet=0). The required accuracy for all the parameters is then established by successively introducing a delta of 10\% on each. This sensitivity analysis is performed on the properties of a shaded kapton patch on a spherical, conducting sunlit spacecraft subject to an ambient plasma environment which will produce large , negative potentials. Two main results are obtained: firstly, identification of the important role played by the high incident energy part of the secondary electron yield curve and secondly the ability of a low density, cold plasma component to limit negative charging.},

Differential charing of spacecraft surfaces can unduce electrostatic discharges which nay manifest themselves as "operational anomalies" or permanent damage to surface features such as solart cells and thermal control surfaces. Understanding of the problem is achieved via laboratory experiments, analysis of data from spacecraft instrumentation and by numerical simulation. Long-term statistical studies are presented for the location of plasma boundaries at geostationary altitude and for the occurrence frequency and intensity of geomagnetic substorms which permits the probabiilty of severe charing conditions to be predicted for future missions. Laboratory experiments are used to demonstrate the importance of bulk and surface conductivity of dielectric materials to the charging process and a sensitivity analysis is employed to investigate the detailed interaction netween the plasma environment and spacecraft surface materials. Finally, a study and simulation of charging events observed in geosynchronous orbit is presented.},

Problems associated with such analysis are highlighted including the need for more relevant test data for electronic devices used in orbit.

Environments examined result from the earth's radiation belts, cosmic rays and solar flares, all of which lead to total dose, damage and single event upset phenomena. THe dependence of these on orbit parameters , and solar cycle is given where relevant. In considering possible orbitsfor surveillance, these results show that Shuttle orbits and sun-synchronous orbits below 1000 km are fairly benign from the point of view of radiation dose and damage, while the higher orbits (above 1600 km) being considered for space-based radar are very stressing and would demand significant hardening. However all high inclination orbits are compeletely exposed to cosmic ray and solar flares are therefore vulnerable to single event upsets and latch-up. Hence the design of surveillance missions must always thake careful account of these phenomena. THis report, together with further applications of the software models described to specific orbit options, can be used  to assess surveillance system possibilities and improve specifications for future miltary space projects.},

  abstract = {Objective measurements of tissue area during histological examination of carcinoma can yield valuable prognostic information. However, such measurements are not made routinely because the current manual approach is time consuming and subject to large statistical sampling error. In this paper, a semi-automated image analysis method for measuring tissue area in histological samples is applied to the measurement of stromal tissue, cell cytoplasm and lumen in samples of pancreatic carcinoma and compared with the standard manual point counting method. Histological samples from 26 cases of pancreatic carcinoma were stained using the sirius red, light-green method. Images from each sample were captured using two magnifications. Image segmentation based on colour cluster analysis was used to subdivide each image into representative colours which were classified manually into one of three tissue components. Area measurements made using this technique were compared to corresponding manual measurements and used to establish the comparative accuracy of the semi-automated image analysis technique, with a quality assurance study to measure the repeatability of the new technique. For both magnifications and for each tissue component, the quality assurance study showed that the semi-automated image analysis algorithm had better repeatability than its manual equivalent. No significant bias was detected between the measurement techniques for any of the comparisons made using the 26 cases of pancreatic carcinoma. The ratio of manual to semi-automatic repeatability errors varied from 2.0 to 3.6. Point counting would need to be increased to be between 400 and 1400 points to achieve the same repeatability as for the semi-automated technique. The results demonstrate that semi-automated image analysis is suitable for measuring tissue fractions in histological samples prepared with coloured stains and is a practical alternative to manual point counting.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is frequently associated with intense growth of fibrous tissue at the periphery of tumours, but the histopathological quantification of this stromal reaction has not yet been used as a prognostic factor because of the difficulty of obtaining quantitative measures using manual methods. Manual histological grading is a poor indicator of outcome in this type of cancer and there is a clinical need to establish a more sensitive indicator. Recent pancreatic tumour biology research has focused upon the stromal reaction and there is an indication that its histopathological quantification may lead to a new prognostic indicator. Histological samples from 21 cases of pancreatic carcinoma were stained using the sirius red, light-green method. Multiple images from the centre and periphery of each tumour were automatically segmented using colour cluster analysis to subdivide each image into representative colours. These were classified manually as stroma, cell cytoplasm or lumen in order to measure the area of each component in each image. Measured areas were analysed to determine whether the technique could detect spatial differences in the area of each tissue component over all samples, and within individual samples. Over all 21 cases, the area of stromal tissue at the periphery of the tumours exceeded that at the centre by an average of 10.0 percentage points (P \textbackslash textless 0.001). Within individual tumours, the algorithm was able to detect significantly more stroma (P \textbackslash textless 0.05) at the periphery than the centre in 11 cases, whilst none of the remaining cases had significantly more stromal tissue at the centre than the periphery. The results demonstrate that semi-automated analysis can be used to detect spatial differences in the area of fibrous tissue in routinely stained sections of pancreatic cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study measured the association between the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) diagnostic and staging criteria and surrogates for baseline serum creatinine (SCr) and body weight, compared urine output (UO) with SCr criteria, and assessed the relationships between use of diuretics and calibration between criteria and prediction of outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: This was a retrospective cohort study using prospective measurements of SCr, hourly UO, body weight, and drug administration records from 5701 patients admitted, after cardiac surgery, to a cardiac intensive care unit between 1995 and 2006. RESULTS: More patients (n=2424, 42.5\%) met SCr diagnostic criteria with calculated SCr assuming a baseline estimated GFR of 75 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) than with known baseline SCr (n=1043, 18.3\%). Fewer patients (n=484, 8.5\%) met UO diagnostic criteria with assumed body weight (70 kg) than with known weight (n=624, 10.9\%). Agreement between SCr and UO criteria was fair (κ=0.28; 95\% confidence interval 0.25-0.31). UO diagnostic criteria were specific (0.95; 0.94-0.95) but insensitive (0.36; 0.33-0.39) compared with SCr. Intravenous diuretics were associated with higher probability of falling below the UO diagnostic threshold compared with SCr, higher 30-day mortality (relative risk, 2.27; 1.08-4.76), and the need for renal support (4.35; 1.82-10.4) compared with no diuretics. CONCLUSIONS: Common surrogates for baseline estimated GFR and body weight were associated with misclassification of AKIN stage. UO criteria were insensitive compared with SCr. Intravenous diuretic use further reduced agreement and confounded association between AKIN stage and 30-day mortality or need for renal support.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have developed a technique for measuring a characteristic of the tracheal tube (TT)-trachea interface: the leak conductance (LC). This study aimed to validate the technique in the laboratory and to compare LC with measurements of fractional volume loss (FVL) in neonates undergoing mechanical ventilation. METHODS: LC, expressed as leak flow at a lung pressure of 10 cm H(2)O, was derived remotely from ventilator pressure and flow signals. Validation was by simulating breathing circuits for 10 models in which LC was measured directly. LC was compared with FVL for different settings of PEEP, inspired pressure, and time at plateau pressure. Clinically, LC was measured for 135 infants admitted to paediatric intensive care after cardiac surgery and compared with FVL. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between direct and remote laboratory measurements of LC (P\textbackslash textgreater0.05). FVL varied with PEEP, plateau pressure, and time at plateau (P\textbackslash textless0.05) but LC did not (P\textbackslash textgreater0.05). The between-patient standard deviation (sd) of LC (0.4 litre min(-1)) exceeded the within-patient sd of lc (0.05 litre min(-1); P\textbackslash textless0.05); the between-patient sd of FVL (22.1\%) exceeded the within-patient sd of FVL (1.3\%; P\textbackslash textless0.05). The median LC was 0.38 (inter-quartile range 0.29-0.46) litre min(-1). LC was correlated with FVL (r=0.82; 95\% confidence interval 0.76-0.88) but wide ranges of FVL were observed for patients with similar LC. CONCLUSIONS: LC can be derived remotely and was correlated with FVL, a conventional proxy for tube fit. It may be a better measure of TT fit than FVL.},

Increasing the cases available to each trainee reduced the Type I error rate but increased the Type II error rate for both sequential tests for all choices of unacceptable failure rate. Discontinuities in the proportion of trainees expected to be test competent were found at critical values of unacceptable failure rate.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: With equivalent parameters, the R-SPRT and LC-CUSUM formulations of sequential tests produced different outcomes, demonstrating that the choice of test method, as well as the choice of parameters, is important in designing a training scheme. The R-SPRT detects incompetence as well as competence and may indicate need for further training. Simulations are valuable in estimating the proportions of trainees expected to be assessed as competent.},

LFUS was applied with two probes immersed in the bacterial suspensions over a range of suspension volumes, intensities, and exposure times. The suspension temperature was measured, and a sample was removed, streaked onto blood agar plates, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Quantitative bacterial counts were then obtained. LFUS resulted in significant reductions in bacterial counts that correlated with fluid temperature. Probe size and ultrasound intensity appeared to affect bacterial counts, but were also correlated with temperature. Bacterial growth was minimal with temperatures exceeding 45 degrees C. While LFUS can reduce bacterial counts, these conditions have the potential to cause burns in humans.},

This study aims to catalogue the published body of studies using HES data to assess health-care outcomes, to assess their methodological qualities and to determine if reporting recommendations can be formulated. Methods: Systematic searches of the EMBASE, Medline and Cochrane databases were performed using defined search terms. Included studies were those that described the use of HES data extracts to assess health-care outcomes. Results: A total of 148 studies were included. The majority of published studies were on surgical specialties (60.8\%), and the most common analytic theme was of inequalities and variations in treatment or outcome (27\%). The volume of published studies has increased with time (r\,=\,0.82, P\,\&lt;\,0.0001), as has the length of study period (r\,=\,0.76, P\,\&lt;\,0.001) and the number of outcomes assessed per study (r\,=\,0.72, P\,=\,0.0023). Age (80\%) and gender (57.4\%) were the most commonly used factors in risk adjustment, and regression modelling was used most commonly (65.2\%) to adjust for confounders. Generic methodologic data were better reported than those specific to HES data extraction. For the majority of parameters, there were no improvements with time. Conclusions: Studies published using HES data to report health-care outcomes have increased in volume, scope and complexity with time. However, persisting deficiencies related to both generic and context-specific reporting have been identified. Recommendations have been made to improve these aspects as it is likely that the role of these studies in assessing health care, benchmarking practice and planning service delivery will continue to increase.},

Study Design and Setting We considered D-RCTs that evaluated diagnostic interventions for any condition and reported effectiveness data on one or more patient outcomes. We calculated odds ratios for patient outcomes and outcomes pertaining to the use of further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for the accuracy of experimental tests. Results One hundred forty trials (153 comparisons) were eligible. Patient outcomes were significantly improved in 28 comparisons (18\%). There was no concordance in significance and direction of effects between the patient outcome and outcomes for use of further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions (weighted κ 0.02 and 0.09, respectively).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare the accuracy of data from hospital administration databases and a national clinical cardiac surgery database and to compare the performance of the Dutch hospital standardised mortality ratio (HSMR) method and the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation, for the purpose of benchmarking of mortality across hospitals. METHODS Information on all patients undergoing cardiac surgery between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2010 in 10 centres was extracted from The Netherlands Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery database and the Hospital Discharge Registry. The number of cardiac surgery interventions was compared between both databases. The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation and hospital standardised mortality ratio models were updated in the study population and compared using the C-statistic, calibration plots and the Brier-score. RESULTS The number of cardiac surgery interventions performed could not be assessed using the administrative database as the intervention code was incorrect in 1.4-26.3\%, depending on the type of intervention. In 7.3\% no intervention code was registered. The updated administrative model was inferior to the updated clinical model with respect to discrimination (c-statistic of 0.77 vs 0.85, p\textbackslash textless0.001) and calibration (Brier Score of 2.8\% vs 2.6\%, p\textbackslash textless0.001, maximum score 3.0\%). Two average performing hospitals according to the clinical model became outliers when benchmarking was performed using the administrative model. CONCLUSIONS In cardiac surgery, administrative data are less suitable than clinical data for the purpose of benchmarking. The use of either administrative or clinical risk-adjustment models can affect the outlier status of hospitals. Risk-adjustment models including procedure-specific clinical risk factors are recommended.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine long-term outcome in patients 50 years of age or younger treated with iliac artery stent placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 412 patients who underwent iliac artery stent placement during a 62-month study period were reviewed retrospectively. Forty-two patients younger than age 50 (mean age = 45 y) at the time of stent placement were included in the study population. Presenting symptoms included claudication (47\%), rest pain (17\%), ulceration/tissue loss (31\%), and blue toe syndrome (5\%). Anatomic, hemodynamic, and clinical success rates of the stent placement procedure were assessed. Stent patency rates were calculated by life-table methods. RESULTS: Fifty-nine iliac lesions were treated with stents; 62\% of patients underwent treatment of a single lesion whereas 38\% had multiple lesions treated. Thirty-one percent were treated after a failed angioplasty procedure and 69\% were treated with stent placement primarily. After stent placement, 34 patients (82\%) experienced symptomatic relief, although eight of these patients (19\%) underwent a planned ipsilateral infrainguinal bypass procedure during the same hospitalization. During follow-up, five patients (12\%) required a bypass procedure as a result of stent failure and two patients (5\%) required below-knee amputation. Seven patients (17\%) required endovascular stent revision, with none requiring additional surgery. At 1, 2, and 3 years, the primary patency rates were 86\%, 72\%, and 65\%, and the secondary patency rates were 90\%, 88\%, and 88\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Iliac stent placement successfully addresses the presenting symptoms of young patients with peripheral vascular disease and results in patency rates that are similar to those reported in a more general population. With appropriate postprocedural surveillance, restenosis can be addressed in many patients with use of endovascular techniques, limiting the need for surgical revision.},

Three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) can quantitate LV volume without these limitations, yet its incremental value over 2DE is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of LV volume determination by 3DE to standard 2DE methods. To compare the accuracy of 3DE with standard 2DE algorithms for quantitating LV volume, 28 excised canine ventricles of known volume and varying shapes (15 symmetric and 13 aneurysmal) and 10 instrumented dogs prepared so that instantaneous ventricular volume could be measured were examined by 2DE (bullet and biplane Simpson's formulas) and again by 3DE. In both excised and beating hearts, 3DE was more accurate in quantitating volume than either 2DE method (excised: error = 0.6 ± 3.2, 2.5 ± 10.7, and 4.0 ± 8.5 ml by 3D, bullet, and Simpson's, respectively; beating: error = −0.5 ± 3.5, −0.3 ± 9.6, and −7.6 ± 8.0 ml by 3DE, bullet, and Simpson's, respectively). This difference in accuracy between 3DE and 2DE methods was especially apparent in asymmetric ventricles distorted by ischemia or right ventricular volume overload. Stroke volume and ejection fraction calculated by 3DE also demonstrated better agreement with actual values than the bullet or Simpson methods with less variability (ejection fraction: error = −0.2\% ± 5.1\%, 7.7\% ± 8.5\%, and 6.8\% ± 12.3\% by 3DE, bullet, and Simpson's, respectively). In both in vitro and in vivo settings, 3DE provides improved accuracy for LV volume and performance than current 2DE algorithms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: When intubating a child's trachea with an uncuffed tracheal tube (TT), it is current practice in anesthesia and intensive care to use the leak test to assess TT fit. The aim of this study is to compare three measures of assessing leak around uncuffed tracheal tubes in the PICU. METHODS: We obtained institutional ethical permission and written informed consent, prior to any clinical investigation, from the parents of 135 children who had surgery for cardiac defects. On admission to the PICU, we measured leak by audible assessment, fractional volume loss, and leak conductance for each patient. Measurements of fractional volume loss and leak conductance were repeated every 4 h thereafter until extubation. RESULTS: On admission to the PICU, calculated values of leak conductance were significantly different between each grade of audible leak (P \textbackslash textless 0.001). Values of fractional volume loss were not significantly different between 'no leak' and 'small leak' grades of leak. Throughout the PICU stay, a significant correlation between mean leak conductance and mean fractional volume loss was found (0.86, 95\% CI, 0.81-0.90). Significant agreement within time series of leak conductance and fractional volume recorded for each patient occurred in 47/128 cases (37\%). CONCLUSIONS: On admission to the PICU, values of leak conductance are more strongly associated with audible assessment than with fractional volume loss. Throughout PICU stay, leak conductance is associated with fractional volume loss. This study demonstrates that leak conductance, calculated from routinely available pressure and flow signals, has the potential to represent the characteristics of the leak interface between a TT and the trachea.},

  abstract = {Summary Tumor growth is considered to depend on tumor cell proliferation and on tumor cell motility. The present study investigates in which way these two cellular properties influence the evolving morphological pattern. Computer simulations were performed, where cells were either dividing or moving for a variable distance at a preset probability. The simulation parameters (probability of motility, maximum moving distance) were set interactively. The resulting patterns were evaluated by binary morphological criteria. 13 of 17 binary criteria showed a significant relationship with the simulation parameters (median test: p = {$<$} 0.05). Discriminant analysis of two sets of simulations with different simulation parameters provided a correct classification with an efficiency of 100\% (k-nearest-neighbour method; jack-knife-procedure). The results indicate that cell proliferation and motility affect morphological patterns in a reproducible way and that the patterns in turn provide morphological clues for the quantitative estimation of motility and proliferation.},

  abstract = {Summary Tumour cell proliferation and particularly tumour cell motility are considered to be essential pre-requisites for invasive tumour growth. Despite abundant in vitro data on tumour cell motility, the behaviour of tumour cells in complex human tumour tissues is yet unknown. In this study, estimates of proliferation and motility are statistically derived from morphological tumour patterns in human melanocytic skin tumours. Two-dimensional, discrete, random computer simulations of tumour growth were carried out in order to determine the influence of tumour cell proliferation and motility on morphological patterns. A set of binary morphological criteria turned out to facilitate a significant estimate of the relative probabilities of motility and proliferation (CART analysis). When the same morphological criteria were applied to H \& E stained slides of 45 melanocytic skin tumours, benign common nevi showed a predominance of motility, whereas primary and metastatic malignant melanoma revealed a predominance of proliferation. The direct assessment of the number of proliferating cells by Ki-67 staining shows a steep increase from benign nevi to primary and metastatic melanoma. These data provide first evidence that in benign common nevi the overall motility exceeds the very low degree of proliferation, whereas in malignant melanocytic tumours proliferation considerably exceeds tumour cell motility.},

  abstract = {Abstract Proliferation and motility are crucial prerequisites for tumorcell invasion in vivo. While proliferation can be assessed in situ by a variety of methods, the measurement of motility is largely restricted to in vitro models. In previous studies, computer simulations of tumor growth strongly indicated that a close relationship exists between tumor-cell motility on the one hand and the resulting morphological pattern on the other. Moreover, estimates of motility parameters can be based on image analysis of the particular pattern. The objective of the present study was to examine whether tumor-cell populations differing in their in vitro motility produce particular patterns in vivo similar to those predicted by the computer simulations, and whether the motility estimates derived from these patterns are consistent with the in vitro motility results. This was done using murine fibrosarcomas grown in syngeneic animals from various cell lines which had been selected for and confirmed to show greatly increased speeds of motility in vitro relative to the unselected parent cell population. Computer simulations coupled with image analysis of the various variant tumors showed that the calculated motility of tumor cells within the different tumors agreed well with the relative levels of tumor-cell motility observed in vitro. Our results thus show that the computer simulation method, along with histological analysis, produced reliable estimates of tumor-cell motility within tumors.},

  abstract = {The metastatic cascade depends on the presence of tumor cells which are capable of proliferation as well as of invasion with active motility. In the present study, it was examined whether the demonstration of both features in the primary lesion of malignant melanoma of the skin carries prognostic significance. Proliferation was assessed by mitotic counts and Ki 67 staining, and motility was estimated by image analysis and comparison of the image analysis results with computer simulations; 27 cases of primary malignant melanoma with a maximum vertical tumor thickness exceeding 1 mm were prospectively sampled. Mitotic counts were carried out on H\&E stained sections, image analysis of the tumor pattern on S-100 immunostained paraffin slides, and Ki67 labeling of actively cycling cells was evaluated on frozen sections. Neither proliferation nor pattern analysis alone provided a significant prognostic result with respect to overall survival and to metastasis free survival. The estimates of motility, derived from a combination of pattern analysis and proliferation values, however, proved to be significant predictors of overall survival and metastasis-free survival (log rank test: p 0.05). The motility features were superior to Clark level and Breslow index in this set of cases. The results demonstrate that the assessment of tumor cell proliferation and motility in histological sections may reflect the metastatic potential of primary malignant melanomas of the skin.},

When we evaluated the morphological patterns of the resulting tumors by image analysis and compared them with computer simulations, we found that the differences of the morphological patterns were the same as predicted by the computer model.

  abstract = {In the diagnosis of melanocytic skin tumors, the assessment of the overall architectural pattern (silhouette) is often essential. We have previously shown by a computer simulation model that tumor patterns are likely to depend on the relative degrees of proliferation and motility of the tumor cells. In this study, we examined the morphological pattern of 12 cases each of nevocellular nevi, primary melanoma, and metastatic melanoma by image analysis. The patterns of the individual melanocytic skin tumors were compared statistically with patterns generated by computer simulation, which facilitates estimates of biological properties of the tumor cells. Additionally, mitotic counts were made to measure tumor cell proliferation. A comparison of the three diagnostic groups revealed that the cells of nevocellular nevi show a low degree of motility, which, however, still exceeds the very low degree of proliferation. Thus, an “invasive” pattern with numerous small nests and single cells at the base of the lesion is common. In primary malignant melanoma, tumor cell motility and tumor cell proliferation are significantly increased in various proportions, thus leading to varying morphological patterns. In metastatic melanoma, a strikingly elevated degree of proliferation exceeds the only slightly elevated degree of motility and leads to sharply demarcated, “expansive” lesions. To check the validity of the technical procedure, estimates of proliferation based on pattern analysis alone were compared with the results obtained by mitotic counts. There was a significant correlation, indicating that the assumptions of the computer model and the image analysis procedure are in fact applicable to real-life melanocytic skin tumors. The study shows that architectural features routinely observed in melanocytic skin tumors are related at least in part to certain biological properties of the tumor cells. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.},

  abstract = {The structure and function of biological systems are considered to be closely related. The present study addresses the question of how histological patterns of tumours are related to specific functional properties of the tumour cells. A mathematical model was developed, which facilitates the simulation of tumour growth and invasion by computer. The degree of cell division, migration and death can be interactively set and the simulation results can be observed on the screen. Additionally, these basic functional properties of a particular cell can be influenced by autocrine and paracrine factors. The study shows that the resulting morphological patterns closely depend on the preset functional properties of the tumour cells. Furthermore, each autocrine or paracrine factor, or combinations of these factors, induce peculiar modifications of the tumour pattern. These results provide evidence that histological tumour patterns reflect functional properties of the tumour cells and their interaction with the micro-environment. Qualitative and quantitative comparison of real tumour specimens with patterns simulated by computer may thus provide a logical base for a functional interpretation of static histological images.},

The risk is small, but elevated in patients with impaired renal function and screening of patients is advised prior to administration. This study examines adherence of UK hospitals to guidance on the use of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA) in MRI. Method This was a prospective study utilising an electronic survey. The sample comprised NHS Trusts in the UK (n~=~174). An invitation was sent to all MRI lead radiographers including a link to the survey. Results 17.6\% indicated they had no written protocol for the GBCA administration within radiology. 41.2\% check blood test results for all patients undergoing a contrast MRI, whereas 45.6\% only check those patients with known renal dysfunction or are high-risk. Comorbidities which categorised patients as high-risk included diabetes, cardiac or vascular disease and age, however the cut off varied from 65 to 75 years old. Six sites indicated point-of-care (POC) creatinine testing would be carried out where bloods were unavailable, a further 12 had considered POC testing and dismissed it as an adjunct to the patient pathway, the most commonly cited reason being the cost. Conclusion Within the UK there is no consistent approach to renal function assessment prior to GBCA administration despite international guidance. POC testing may have a role to play, but a lack of evaluation in radiology has led to concerns that it may constrain capacity and increase costs.},

Tragically, although severe hypercholesterolemia is easy to recognize, type III hyperlipoproteinemia cannot be diagnosed using a conventional lipid panel (4) and the original diagnostic tools—electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation—are available in only a miniscule number of clinics (1). Thus, type III cannot be diagnosed in regular clinical care using regular diagnostic tools. Moreover, while the importance of FH is recognized by all the major lipid guidelines, even the existence of type III hyperlipoproteinemia is barely acknowledged, if at all, by the same groups. Consequently, those patients with type III are lumped and dumped with all the others with mixed hyperlipidemia and the result, tragically, can be no treatment when treatment is indicated. In a wonderful paper (3), Paul Hopkins and his colleagues referred to type III hyperlipoproteinemia as the “forgotten phenotype.” Nothing has changed and so the extended title of this editorial.},

  abstract = {Background. Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 currently relies on assessment of risk followed by invasive testing in the 5\% of pregnancies at the highest estimated risk. Selection of the high-risk group by a combination of maternal age and second-trimester maternal serum biochemistry gives a detection rate of about 60\%. We investigated assessment of risk by a combination of maternal age and fetal nuchal-translucency thickness, measured by ultrasonography at 10-14 weeks of gestation. Methods. The risk of trisomy 21 was estimated for 96,127 women of median age 31 years (range 14-49) with singleton pregnancies. Ultrasonography was done by 306 appropriately trained sonographers in 22 centres. Risk of trisomy 21 was calculated from the maternal age and gestational-age-related prevalence, multiplied by a likelihood ratio depending on the deviation from normal in nuchal-translucency thickness for crown-rump length. The distribution of risks was investigated and the sensitivity of a cut-off risk of 1 in 300 was calculated. Phenotype was assessed by fetal karyotyping or clinical examination of liveborn infants. Findings. The estimated trisomy-21 risk, from maternal age and fetal nuchal-translucency thickness, was 1 in 300 or higher in 7907 (8.3\%) of 95,476 normal pregnancies, 268 (82.2\%) of 326 with trisomy 21, and 253 (77.9\%) of 325 with other chromosomal defects. The 5\% of the study population with the highest estimated risk included 77\% of trisomy-21 cases. Interpretation. Selection of the high-risk group for invasive testing by this method allows the detection of about 80\% of affected pregnancies. However, even this method of risk assessment requires about 30 invasive tests for identification of one affected fetus.},

  abstract = {Background Post-market surveillance is needed to evaluate the real-world clinical effectiveness and safety of U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved devices. Objectives The authors examined the commercial experience with transcatheter mitral valve repair for the treatment of mitral regurgitation. Methods Data from the Society of Thoracic Surgery/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry on patients commercially treated with transcatheter mitral valve repair were analyzed. The study population consisted of 2,952 patients treated at 145 hospitals between November 2013 and September 2015. In 1,867 patients, data were linked to patient-specific Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrative claims for analyses. Results The median age was 82 years (55.8\% men), with a median Society of Thoracic Surgery predicted risk of mortality of 6.1\% (interquartile range: 3.7\% to 9.9\%) and 9.2\% (interquartile range: 6.0\% to 14.1\%) for mitral repair and replacement, respectively. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 2.7\%. Acute procedure success occurred in 91.8\%. Among the patients with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services linkage data, the mortality at 30~days and at 1 year was 5.2\% and 25.8\%, respectively, and repeat hospitalization for heart failure at 1 year occurred in 20.2\%. Variables associated with mortality or rehospitalization for heart failure after multivariate adjustment were increasing age, lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, worse post-procedural mitral regurgitation, moderate or severe lung disease, dialysis, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that commercial transcatheter mitral valve repair is being performed in the~United States with acute effectiveness and safety. Our findings may help determine which patients have favorable long-term outcomes with this therapy.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Recent debates and events have brought into question the effectiveness of existing regulatory frameworks for medical devices in the United States and Europe to ensure their performance, safety, and quality. This article provides a comparative analysis of medical device regulation in the two jurisdictions, explores current reforms to improve the existing systems, and discusses additional actions that should be considered to fully meet this aim. Medical device regulation must be improved to safeguard public health and ensure that high-quality and effective technologies reach patients. METHODS: We explored and analyzed medical device regulatory systems in the United States and Europe in accordance with the available gray and peer-reviewed literature and legislative documents. FINDINGS: The two regulatory systems differ in their mandate and orientation, organization, pre- and postmarket evidence requirements, and transparency of process. Despite these differences, both jurisdictions face similar challenges for ensuring that only safe and effective devices reach the market, monitoring real-world use, and exchanging pertinent information on devices with key users such as clinicians and patients. To address these issues, reforms have recently been introduced or debated in the United States and Europe that are principally focused on strengthening regulatory processes, enhancing postmarket regulation through more robust surveillance systems, and improving the traceability and monitoring of devices. Some changes in premarket requirements for devices are being considered. CONCLUSIONS: Although the current reforms address some of the outstanding challenges in device regulation, additional steps are needed to improve existing policy. We examine a number of actions to be considered, such as requiring high-quality evidence of benefit for medium- and high-risk devices; moving toward greater centralization and coordination of regulatory approval in Europe; creating links between device identifier systems and existing data collection tools, such as electronic health records; and fostering increased and more effective use of registries to ensure safe postmarket use of new and existing devices.},

Endoscopists recognise Barrett's oesophagus because the dull red of the metaplastic columnar epithelium contrasts sharply with the pale glossy normal squamous lining (figure).Long segment Barrett's oesophagus. The dull red of the metaplastic columnar epithelium contrasts with the pale, glossy appearance of the normal squamous liningBarrett's oesophagus is classified as long segment or short segment, depending on whether or not the specialised intestinal metaplasia extends 3 cm or more above the gastro-oesophageal junction.5 Among patients who have endoscopy for symptoms of reflux, long segment Barrett's oesophagus is found in 3-5\% and short segment disease in 10-15\%.1 Although it is not clear whether long and short …},

The two groups' gaze patterns appear to differ for dynamic videos of social scenes, but not for static photos of isolated individuals. The present study replicated and extended previous research by comparing the gaze patterns of individuals with and without autism for four types of stimuli: social dynamic, social static, isolated dynamic, and isolated static. Participants with autism differed from their typically developing peers only for social-dynamic stimuli; fixation durations were decreased for eye regions and increased for body regions. Further, these fixation durations predicted scores on a measure of social responsiveness. These findings reconcile differences in previous reports by identifying the specific social and dynamic task components associated with autism-related face processing impairments.},

  abstract = {Increasingly complex models are being used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of medical interventions. We describe the multiple sources of uncertainty that are relevant to such models, and their relation to either probabilistic or deterministic sensitivity analysis. A Bayesian approach appears natural in this context. We explore how sensitivity analysis to patient heterogeneity and parameter uncertainty can be simultaneously investigated, and illustrate the necessary computation when expected costs and benefits can be calculated in closed form, such as in discrete-time discrete-state Markov models. Information about parameters can either be expressed as a prior distribution, or derived as a posterior distribution given a generalized synthesis of available data in which multiple sources of evidence can be differentially weighted according to their assumed quality. The resulting joint posterior distributions on costs and benefits can then provide inferences on incremental cost-effectiveness, best presented as posterior distributions over net-benefit and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. These ideas are illustrated with a detailed running example concerning the cost-effectiveness of hip prostheses in different age-sex subgroups. All computations are carried out using freely available software for conducting Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

The results reveal interaction-dominant dynamics in eye movements in each of the three tasks, and that fine-grained eye movements are modulated by task constraints.

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with an increased long-term risk of stroke. A screening test for early diagnosis has the potential to prevent AF-related strokes. This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of an automated device for self-home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, which implements an algorithm for AF detection. A modified, automated oscillometric device for self-home BP monitoring (Microlife BPA100 Plus, Microlife, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) with an AF detector was used to carry out triplicate BP measurements in subjects with sinus rhythm, AF and non-AF arrhythmias. During each BP measurement, the electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded simultaneously. A total of 217 simultaneous BP measurements and ECG recordings were obtained from 73 subjects. Twenty-seven subjects (37\%) had AF, 23 (31\%) non-AF arrhythmias and 23 (31\%) had sinus rhythm. A single measurement had 93\% sensitivity and 89\% specificity for detecting AF. For two measurements, in which one of them was required to detect AF, the sensitivity was 100\% and specificity 76\%, whereas for three measurements, in which two of them were required to detect AF, the sensitivity was 100\% and specificity 89\% (kappa=0.86 for an agreement with ECG). Using the latter approach, there were five false positive cases all having irregularities in approximately 50\% of the heartbeats. In patients with tachyarrhythmia, the device underestimated heart rate. These data suggest that an electronic device for self-home BP monitoring, which implements an algorithm for AF diagnosis has an excellent diagnostic accuracy and might, therefore, be used as a reliable screening test for the early diagnosis.},

Participants: 3230 people with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or heart failure recruited from practices between May 2008 and November 2009. Interventions: Telehealth involved remote exchange of data between patients and healthcare professionals as part of patients' diagnosis and management. Usual care reflected the range of services available in the trial sites, excluding telehealth. Main outcome measure: Proportion of patients admitted to hospital during 12 month trial period. Results: Patient characteristics were similar at baseline. Compared with controls, the intervention group had a lower admission proportion within 12 month follow-up (odds ratio 0.82, 95\% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.97, P=0.017). Mortality at 12 months was also lower for intervention patients than for controls (4.6\% v 8.3\%; odds ratio 0.54, 0.39 to 0.75, P\textbackslash textless0.001). These differences in admissions and mortality remained significant after adjustment. The mean number of emergency admissions per head also differed between groups (crude rates, intervention 0.54 v control 0.68); these changes were significant in unadjusted comparisons (incidence rate ratio 0.81, 0.65 to 1.00, P=0.046) and after adjusting for a predictive risk score, but not after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Length of hospital stay was shorter for intervention patients than for controls (mean bed days per head 4.87 v 5.68; geometric mean difference -0.64 days, -1.14 to -0.10, P=0.023, which remained significant after adjustment). Observed differences in other forms of hospital use, including notional costs, were not significant in general. Differences in emergency admissions were greatest at the beginning of the trial, during which we observed a particularly large increase for the control group. Conclusions: Telehealth is associated with lower mortality and emergency admission rates. The reasons for the short term increases in admissions for the control group are not clear, but the trial recruitment processes could have had an effect.

Part of the evaluation of the Whole Systems Demonstrator trial.Participants and setting: a total of 2,600 people with social care needs were recruited from 217 general practices in three areas in England. DESIGN: a cluster randomised trial comparing telecare with usual care, general practice being the unit of randomisation. Participants were followed up for 12 months and analyses were conducted as intention-to-treat.Data sources: trial data were linked at the person level to administrative data sets on care funded at least in part by local authorities or the National Health Service.Main outcome measures: the proportion of people admitted to hospital within 12 months. Secondary endpoints included mortality, rates of secondary care use (seven different metrics), contacts with general practitioners and practice nurses, proportion of people admitted to permanent residential or nursing care, weeks in domiciliary social care and notional costs. RESULTS: 46.8\% of intervention participants were admitted to hospital, compared with 49.2\% of controls. Unadjusted differences were not statistically significant (odds ratio: 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.75-1.07, P = 0.211). They reached statistical significance after adjusting for baseline covariates, but this was not replicated when adjusting for the predictive risk score. Secondary metrics including impacts on social care use were not statistically significant.

  abstract = {Aims Hospital activity represents the major component of health care expenditure related to heart failure. This study evaluated the economic impact of applying specialist nurse management programmes that limit heart failure-related hospital readmissions within a whole population.Methods Using a reliable and validated estimate of the current level and cost of heart failure-related hospital activity in the U.K., we determined the thresholds at which the actual cost of establishing and applying a national service based on three different models of specialist nurse management would be equal to the ‘cost’ of bed utilization associated with preventable hospital readmissions in the year 2000. The three models of care examined were home-based, clinic-based or a combination of home plus clinic-based, post-discharge follow-up. The potential impact of this service was based on a U.K.-wide caseload of 122000 patients discharged to home with a discharge diagnosis of congestive heart failure in that year.Results Based on heart failure-specific patterns of hospital activity, we estimate that 47000 of these 122000 patients would normally accumulate a total of 594000 days of associated hospital stay from 49000 readmissions (for any reason) within 1 year of hospital discharge. The cost of these admissions to the National Health Service was calculated at £166·2 million. Taking into account other costs associated with such hospital activity (e.g. general practice and hospital outpatient visits) each 10\% reduction in recurrent bed utilization would be associated with £18·0 million in cost savings. Alternatively, the cost of applying a U.K.-wide programme of home-, clinic- or home plus clinic-based follow-up was calculated to be £69·4, £73·1 and £72·5 million per annum, respectively. The relative thresholds at which generated ‘cost-savings’ would equal the cost of applying these programmes of care would therefore be a 38·5\%, 40·6\% and 40·3\% reduction in recurrent bed utilization, respectively. If, as expected, a home-based programme of specialist nurse management reduced recurrent bed utilization by 50\% or more, annual savings equivalent to £169000 per 1000 patients treated would be generated.Conclusions This is the first study to examine the economic consequences of applying a specialist nurse-mediated, post-discharge management service for heart failure within a whole population. Our findings suggest that such a service will not only improve quality of life and reduce readmissions in patients with congestive heart failure, but also reduce costs and improve the efficiency of the health care system in doing so.

  abstract = {Cuffed endotracheal tubes are one aspect of airway management designed to ensure safety, yet patients can be at risk for injury from underinflated and overinflated endotracheal cuffs. Tracheal pressures exceeding approximately 48 cm H2O impede capillary blood flow, potentially causing tracheal damage, and pressures below approximately 18 mm Hg may increase the risk of aspiration. There is no standard identified in the literature describing the method of cuff inflation, and nurse anesthetists use various cuff inflation techniques. The purpose of this study was to compare endotracheal cuff pressures obtained by estimation techniques with direct endotracheal cuff pressure measurements. A convenience sample of 40 anesthesia providers (nurse anesthesia students, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists, and anesthesiologists) inflated the endotracheal tube cuff using their usual inflation technique. The endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured with a noninvasive manometer connected to the pilot balloon. Pressures obtained by estimation techniques ranged from 6 to 60 cm H2O (mean = 44.5; SD = 13.07). Analysis revealed that fewer than one third of the anesthesia providers inflated the cuff within an ideal range. No differences were found between level of anesthesia provider and cuff inflation pressures. We conclude that estimation techniques for cuff inflation are inadequate and suggest that direct measurements be used.},

  abstract = {Pulse oximetry has been extensively used to estimate oxygen saturation in blood, a vital physiological parameter commonly used when monitoring a subject's health status. However, accurate estimation of this parameter is difficult to achieve when the fundamental signal from which it is derived, the photoplethysmograph (PPG), is contaminated with noise artifact induced by movement of the subject or the measurement apparatus. This study presents a novel method for automatic rejection of artifact contaminated pulse oximetry waveforms, based on waveform morphology analysis. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to a manually annotated gold standard. The creation of the gold standard involved two experts identifying sections of the PPG signal containing good quality PPG pulses and/or noise, in 104 fingertip PPG signals, using a simultaneous electrocardiograph (ECG) signal as a reference signal. The fingertip PPG signals were each 1 min in duration and were acquired from 13 healthy subjects (10 males and 3 females). Each signal contained approximately 20 s of purposely induced artifact noise from a variety of activities involving subject movement. Some unique waveform morphology features were extracted from the PPG signals, which were believed to be correlated with signal quality. A simple decision-tree classifier was employed to arrive at a classification decision, at a pulse-by-pulse resolution, of whether a pulse was of acceptable quality for use or not. The performance of the algorithm was assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy measures. A mean κ of 0.64 ± 0.22 was obtained, while the mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 89 ± 10\%, 77 ± 19\% and 83 ± 11\%, respectively. Furthermore, a heart rate estimate, extracted from uncontaminated sections of PPG, as identified by the algorithm, was compared with the heart rate derived from an uncontaminated simultaneous ECG signal. The mean error between both heart rate readings was 0.49 ± 0.66 beats per minute (BPM), in comparison to an error value observed without using the artifact detection algorithm of 7.23 ± 5.78 BPM. These results demonstrate that automated identification of signal artifact in the PPG signal through waveform morphology analysis is achievable. In addition, a clear improvement in the accuracy of the derived heart rate is also evident when such methods are employed.},

However, less is know about how consistently a PRL is used in ordinary behavior, where high resolution may not always be needed. We investigated eye movements of a Stargardt's disease patient, with bilateral central scotomas, in three tasks in both real and virtual environments. While making a sandwich, the subject predominantly located the object being manipulated in the lower left visual field, scattered over a 20?? ?? 30?? region. While catching a ball our subject positioned the ball in the lower left visual quadrant and also exhibited pursuit eye movements driven by the peripheral retina. While walking in a virtual environment, the patient did not use a PRL but instead centered gaze on pedestrians, whose vertical extent surpassed the boundaries of the scotoma. In the natural tasks studied the PRL is very broadly defined and depends on the resolution required for the task. We therefore suggest use of the term "preferred retinal region". ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These capacities include a desirable range of sound intensity and frequency, which can be measured and represented in a phonetogram. The influence of specific factors on voice capacities may be ascertained by the analysis of phonetograms. To determine the influence of the factors gender and voice training, phonetograms of 224 subjects, subdivided accordingly into four groups, were analyzed in two different ways. One is based on the rescaling of phonetograms, whereas the other derives analytic variables from the features' shape, area, and dynamic range. Analysis showed that, regarding gender, male subjects are able to produce softer phonations, whereas female subjects produced louder phonations at specific parts of their comparable frequency ranges. Trained subjects have a larger enclosed area of the phonetogram, which is primarily based on extended soft voice capabilities in both genders and the significantly larger frequency range in trained female subjects. The shape analysis, performed with Fourier Descriptors, revealed differences for the factors gender and training.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought a model to estimate preanalytical uncertainty of blood samples collected and processed by using optimal procedures. METHODS: Optimal preanalytical handling of blood samples included use of a loosely fastened tourniquet, wide bore needles, recommended clotting time and centrifugation speed, and minimal storage before analysis. Blood was collected from each arm of 20 volunteers into 2 rapid-serum tubes and 2 serum-separation tubes. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the between-venipuncture SD, the preanalytical SD (excluding venipuncture), the measurement repeatability SD, and systematic differences between the tubes and between venipunctures. RESULTS: No significant systematic differences were found between successive venipunctures. However, statistically significant mean differences were seen between serum-separation tubes and rapid-serum tubes for 7 of the 15 analytes. The preanalytical SD (excluding venipuncture) for lactate dehydrogenase (3.2 U/L, 95\% CI 2.8-3.7) was significantly higher than the SD for measurement repeatability (1.9 U/L, 95\% CI 1.7-2.1). For potassium both the preanalytical SD (excluding venipuncture) (0.092 mmol/L, 95\% CI 0.080-0.11) and the between-venipuncture SD (0.075 mmol/L, 95\% CI 0.048-0.12) were significantly higher than the measurement-repeatability SD (0.031 mmol/L, 95\% CI 0.028-0.035). For glucose the between-venipuncture SD (0.20 mmol/L, 95\% CI 0.14-0.27) was significantly higher than the preanalytical SD (excluding venipuncture) (0.07 mmol/L, 95\% CI 0.06-0.08), and the measurement repeatability SD (0.057 mmol/L, 95\% CI 0.051-0.064). CONCLUSIONS: By applying linear mixed-effects models we have estimated the minimal preanalytical uncertainty that will influence all patient results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) using 12-lead-electrocardiograms (ECGs) has been recommended; however, the best method for interpreting ECGs to diagnose AF is not known. We compared accuracy of methods for diagnosing AF from ECGs.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACS until March 24, 2014. Two reviewers identified eligible studies, extracted data and appraised quality using the QUADAS-2 instrument. Meta-analysis, using the bivariate hierarchical random effects method, determined average operating points for sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR, NLR) and enabled construction of Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (SROC) plots.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: 10 studies investigated 16 methods for interpreting ECGs (n=55,376 participant ECGs). The sensitivity and specificity of automated software (8 studies; 9 methods) were 0.89 (95\% C.I. 0.82-0.93) and 0.99 (95\% C.I. 0.99-0.99), respectively; PLR 96.6 (95\% C.I. 64.2-145.6); NLR 0.11 (95\% C.I. 0.07-0.18). Indirect comparisons with software found healthcare professionals (5 studies; 7 methods) had similar sensitivity for diagnosing AF but lower specificity [sensitivity 0.92 (95\% C.I. 0.81-0.97), specificity 0.93 (95\% C.I. 0.76-0.98), PLR 13.9 (95\% C.I. 3.5-55.3), NLR 0.09 (95\% C.I. 0.03-0.22)]. Sub-group analyses of primary care professionals found greater specificity for GPs than nurses [GPs: sensitivity 0.91 (95\% C.I. 0.68-1.00); specificity 0.96 (95\% C.I. 0.89-1.00).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Development of guidelines for publication of evaluation studies of Health Informatics applications. METHODS: An initial list of issues to be addressed in reports on evaluation studies was drafted based on experiences as editors and reviewers of journals in Health Informatics and as authors of systematic reviews of Health Informatics studies, taking into account guidelines for reporting of medical research. This list has been discussed in several rounds by an increasing number of experts in Health Informatics evaluation during conferences and by using e-mail and has been put up for comments on the web. RESULTS: A set of STARE-HI principles to be addressed in papers describing evaluations of Health Informatics interventions is presented. These principles include formulation of title and abstract, of introduction (e.g. scientific background, study objectives), study context (e.g. organizational setting, system details), methods (e.g. study design, outcome measures), results (e.g. study findings, unexpected observations) and discussion and conclusion of an IT evaluation paper. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive list of principles relevant for properly describing Health Informatics evaluations has been developed. When manuscripts submitted to Health Informatics journals and general medical journals adhere to these aspects, readers will be better positioned to place the studies in a proper context and judge their validity and generalisability. It will also be possible to judge better whether papers will fit in the scope of meta-analyses of Health Informatics interventions. STARE-HI may also be used for study planning and hence positively influence the quality of evaluation studies in Health Informatics. We believe that better publication of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation studies is an important step toward the vision of evidence-based Health Informatics. LIMITATIONS: This study is based on experiences from editors, reviewers, authors of systematic reviews and readers of the scientific literature. The applicability of the principles has not been evaluated in real practice. Only when authors start to use these principles for reporting, shortcomings in the principles will emerge.},

  abstract = {Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has proven morbidity and mortality benefits in cardiovascular disease, which directly correlates with exercise performance achieved. Many patients in CR exercise at sub-optimal levels, without obvious limitations. Occult lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) may be a determinant of diminished exercise capacity and reduced benefit obtained from traditional CR. In this prospective study of 150 consecutive patients enrolled in Phase II CR, we describe the prevalence of PAD, the utility of externally validated screening questionnaires, and the observed impact on CR outcomes. Abnormal ankle?brachial indices (ABI) ({$<$}0.9 and {$>$}1.4) were observed in 19\% of those studied. The Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire was insensitive for detecting PAD by low ABI in this population, and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire and a modified Gardner protocol demonstrated a lack of typical symptoms with low levels of activity. Importantly, at completion of traditional CR, exercise improvement measured in metabolic equivalents (METs) was worse in those with a low ABI compared to those with a normal ABI (+1.39 vs +2.41 METs, p=0.002). In conclusion, PAD is common in patients in Phase II CR and often clinically occult. Screening based on standard questionnaires appears insensitive in this population, suggesting a need for a broad-based screening strategy with ABI measurements. In this study, undiagnosed PAD significantly attenuated improvements in exercise performance, which potentially has bearings on future clinical events.},

  abstract = {Background: Efforts to improve the quality of surgical care in the United States have led many organizations to advocate the use of high-volume hospitals for complex surgical procedures and/or comprehensive multidisciplinary care. The benefits, if any, of selective referral to high-volume hospitals for immediate breast reconstruction are relatively unknown. It is this gap in knowledge that forms the basis for the current study. Methods: Using California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development discharge database, all patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 1999, were identified. Information regarding demographic, comorbidity, complication, and hospital volume characteristics was obtained. Patient comorbidity was graded using a modified version of the Charlson score. Annual hospital volume was categorized into patient quartiles. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of surgical complications. Results: A total of 2691 patients were included: 1271 had immediate autogenous tissue reconstruction and 1420 had immediate tissue expander placement. The complication rate was 11.6 percent among patients undergoing autogenous reconstruction and 2.4 percent among patients receiving tissue expanders. For autogenous reconstruction, complications were more likely in patients with comorbidities (odds ratio, 2.24) and in patients receiving care at very-low-volume (less than eight) and medium-volume (20 to 41) hospitals (odds ratio, 1.81 and 1.90, respectively). For tissue expander reconstruction, patient comorbidity (odds ratio, 2.42) was the only significant predictor of complications. Conclusions: Hospital volume appears to be an important predictor of patient outcome with regard to autogenous reconstruction but not tissue expander reconstruction. Patient comorbidity predicts complications for both autogenous and tissue expander reconstruction. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 129: 19, 2012.) CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, III.},

  abstract = {Objectives:  To examine the effect of severity of acute kidney injury or renal recovery on risk-adjusted mortality across different intensive care unit settings. Acute kidney injury in intensive care unit patients is associated with significant mortality. Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: There were 325,395 of 617,927 consecutive admissions to all 191 Veterans Affairs ICUs across the country. Patients: Large national cohort of patients admitted to Veterans Affairs ICUs and who developed acute kidney injury during their intensive care unit stay. Measurements and Main Results: Outcome measures were hospital mortality, and length of stay. Acute kidney injury was defined as a 0.3-mg/dL increase in creatinine relative to intensive care unit admission and categorized into Stage I (0.3 mg/dL to {$<$}2 times increase), Stage II (≥2 and {$<$}3 times increase), and Stage III (≥3 times increase or dialysis requirement). Association of mortality and length of stay with acute kidney injury stages and renal recovery was examined. Overall, 22\% (n = 71,486) of patients developed acute kidney injury (Stage I: 17.5\%; Stage II: 2.4\%; Stage III: 2\%); 16.3\% patients met acute kidney injury criteria within 48 hrs, with an additional 5.7\% after 48 hrs of intensive care unit admission. Acute kidney injury frequency varied between 9\% and 30\% across intensive care unit admission diagnoses. After adjusting for severity of illness in a model that included urea and creatinine on admission, odds of death increased with increasing severity of acute kidney injury. Stage I odds ratio = 2.2 (95\% confidence interval, 2.17–2.30); Stage II odds ratio = 6.1 (95\% confidence interval, 5.74, 6.44); and Stage III odds ratio = 8.6 (95\% confidence interval, 8.07–9.15). Acute kidney injury patients with sustained elevation of creatinine experienced higher mortality risk than those who recovered. Interventions: None. Conclusions: Admission diagnosis and severity of illness influence frequency and severity of acute kidney injury. Small elevations in creatinine in the intensive care unit are associated with increased risk-adjusted mortality across all intensive care unit settings, whereas renal recovery was associated with a protective effect. Strategies to prevent even mild acute kidney injury or promote renal recovery may improve survival.},

In this study, we validated a new diagnostic device, the MyDiagnostick, for detection of AF by general practitioners and patients. It records and stores a Lead I electrocardiogram (ECG) which is automatically analysed for the presence of AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 192 patients (age 69.4 ± 12.6 years) were asked to hold the MyDiagnostick for 1 min, immediately before a routine 12-lead ECG was recorded. Atrial fibrillation detection and ECGs stored by the MyDiagnostick were compared with the cardiac rhythm on the 12-lead ECG. In a second part of the study, the MyDiagnostick was used to screen for AF during influenza vaccination in the general practitioner's office. Atrial fibrillation was present in 53 out of the 192 patients (27.6\%). All AF patients were correctly detected by the MyDiagnostick (sensitivity 100\%; 95\% confidence interval 93-100\%). MyDiagnostick AF classification in 6 out of 139 patients in sinus rhythm was considered false positive (specificity 95.9\%; 95\% confidence interval 91.3-98.1\%). During 4 h of influenza vaccination in 676 patients (age 74 ± 7.1 years), the MyDiagnostick correctly diagnosed AF in all 55 patients (prevalence 8.1\%). In 11 patients (1.6\%), AF was not diagnosed before, all with a CHA2DS2VASc score of \textbackslash textgreater1. CONCLUSION: The high AF detection performance of the MyDiagnostick, combined with the ease of use of the device, enables large screening programmes for detection of undiagnosed AF.},

In 30 patients (14 males; mean age 52 [range, 26?81]) admitted between 1999 and 2003 with osteomyelitis of the pelvis or lower extremity, we assessed time to wound closure, number of surgical procedures and rate of recurrence of infection as well as need for rehospitalizations. For comparison, a control group of 94 patients (males, 58; mean age 47 [range, 9?85]), matched for site and severity of osteomyelitis, was identified in hospital records between 1982 and 2002. These patients underwent standard surgical debridement, implantation of gentamicin polymethylmethacrylate beads and long-term intravenous antibiotics. In the Instillation group the rate of recurrence of infection was 3/30 (10\%), whereas 55/93 (58.5\%) of the controls had a recurrence (p{$<$}0.0001). Moreover, in those treated with instillation the total duration of hospital stay was shorter and number of surgical procedures smaller as compared with the controls (all p{$<$}0.0001). We conclude that in posttraumatic osteomyelitis negative pressure instillation therapy reduces the need for repeated surgical interventions in comparison with the present standard approach.},

However, there are no structured reporting requirements for studies of this design to assist authors, editors, and readers. The authors developed and tested a checklist of criteria related to threats to the internal and external validity of observational longitudinal studies. The checklist criteria concerned recruitment, data collection, biases, and data analysis and descriptive issues relevant to study rationale, study population, and generalizability. Two raters independently assessed 49 randomly selected articles describing stroke research published from 1999 to 2003 in six journals: American Journal of Epidemiology, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, Stroke, Annals of Neurology, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. On average, 17 of the 33 checklist criteria were reported. Criteria describing the study design were better reported than those related to internal validity. No relation was found between study type (etiologic or prognostic) or word count and quality of reporting. A flow diagram for summarizing participant flow through a study was developed. Editors and authors should consider using a checklist and flow diagram when reporting on observational longitudinal research.},

To better understand the FTD subtypes and develop more specific treatments, correct diagnosis is essential. This study aimed to test the discrimination power of a novel set of cortical Diffusion Tensor Imaging measures (DTI), on FTD subtypes. A total of 96 subjects with FTD and 84 healthy subjects (HS) were included in the study. A “selection cohort” was used to determine the set of features (measurements) and to use them to select the “best” machine learning classifier from a range of seven main models. The selected classifier was trained on a “training cohort” and tested on a third cohort (“test cohort”). The classifier was used to assess the classification power for binary (HS vs. FTD), and multiclass (HS and FTD subtypes) classification problems. In the binary classification, one of the new DTI features obtained the highest accuracy (85\%) as a single feature, and when it was combined with other DTI features and two other common clinical measures (grey matter fraction and MMSE), obtained an accuracy of 88\%. The new DTI features can distinguish between HS and FTD subgroups with an accuracy of 76\%. These results suggest that DTI measures could support differential diagnosis in a clinical setting, potentially improve efficacy of new innovative drug treatments through effective patient selection, stratification and measurement of outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess the relation between coronary vasomotor effects of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (LNMMA) administration and coronary stenosis morphology, length, and severity in patients with stable angina. DESIGN In 28 patients (24 male, four female) with coronary artery disease and chronic stable angina, intracoronary normal saline and 4\,μmol/min LNMMA were infused for four minutes each, followed by an intracoronary bolus of 250\,μg glyceryl trinitrate. Coronary stenoses were classified as concentric (smooth), eccentric (smooth), or complicated (irregular). The diameters of these stenoses and their adjacent reference proximal segments were measured by quantitative angiography. RESULTS During LNMMA infusion a significantly larger proportion of complicated stenoses than concentric and eccentric stenoses constricted by ⩾\,5\% (p\,\&lt;\,0.01) and the magnitude of vasoconstriction was greater in complicated than in concentric and eccentric stenoses (p\,\&lt;\,0.05). For complicated stenoses the magnitude of constriction (in mm) with reference to normal saline was greater than that of the concentric and eccentric stenoses (p\,\&lt;\,0.05), whereas concentric and eccentric stenoses constricted similarly. Irrespective of the type of morphology, there was a correlation (p\,\&lt;\,0.05) between both the severity and the length of stenoses and the magnitude of vasoconstriction to LNMMA. A similar proportion of concentric, eccentric, and complicated stenoses showed ⩾\,5\% increase in diameter with glyceryl trinitrate, and the magnitude of the response was similar in the three groups. CONCLUSIONS In patients with coronary artery disease, the response to LNMMA is greater when stenosis morphology is complex, indicating greater nitric oxide activity. This provides further evidence that plaques with complex morphology are in an active state.},

  abstract = {AIM: To evaluate in a multicenter study whether the sonographic characterization of focal liver lesions can be improved using SonoVue-enhancement; and to compare this method with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: One hundred and thirty four patients with one focal liver lesion detected in baseline ultrasound (US) were examined with conventional US, contrast-enhanced US (n = 134), contrast-enhanced CT (n = 115) and/or dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (n = 70). The lesions were classified as malignant, benign or indeterminate and the type of lesion was determined. The final diagnosis based on the combined information of all imaging examinations, clinical information and histology (n = 32) was used. Comparisons were made to see whether the addition of contrast-enhanced US led to the improvement of the characterization of doubtful focal liver lesions. RESULTS: In comparison with unenhanced US, SonoVue markedly improves sensitivity and specificity for the characterization (malignant/benign) of focal liver lesions. In comparison with CT and/or dynamic MRI, SonoVue-enhanced sonography applied for characterization of focal liver lesions was 30.2\% more sensitive in the recognition of malignancy and 16.1\% more specific in the exclusion of malignancy and overall 22.9\% more accurate. In the subgroup with confirmative histology available (n = 30), sensitivity was 95.5\% (CEUS), 72.2\% (CT) and 81.8\% (MRI), and specificity was 75.0\% (CEUS), 37.5\% (CT) and 42.9\% (MRI). The sensitivity and specificity of CEUS for the identification of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and hemangiomas was 100\% and 87\%, resulting in an accuracy of 94.5\%. CONCLUSION: SonoVue-enhanced sonography emerges as the most sensitive, most specific and thus most accurate imaging modality for the characterization of focal liver lesions.},

The count rates observed by the two types of detector flown (sodium iodide and bismuth  germanate) are compared with the prediceted variation of the cosmic-ray vertical cut-off rigidity, as well as the predicted trapped particle environment, based on the AP8MAX and AE8MAX models of the radiation belts. The observed count rate is found to be closely correlated with the predicted vertical cut-off rigidity, and times of expected increases in trapped radiation levels are in good agreement with the count rate enhancements observed when the spacecraft is in the South Atlantic Anomaly region or the high latitude outer electron belts. Higher gamma radiation levels, resulting from cosmic-ray interactions with spacecraft materials, are experienced when the detectors are in the more shielded locations of the spacecraft. This situation is reversed parts of the orbit when the count rates are dominated by trapped radiation, and higher rates are observed at less well shielded locations of Shuttle. South Atlantic Anomaly radiation gives rise to overall enhancements in the pulse-height spectra collected, indicating that trapped protons are of importance in this region.},

The Shuttle flights have included passive packages in addition to the active cosmic ray monitor which comprises an array of pin diodes. These are positioned at a number of locations to investigate the influence of shielding and local materials. Use of both metal activation foils and scintillator crystals enables neutron fluences to be inferred from the induced radioactivity which is observed on return to Earth. Supporting radiation transport calculations are performed to predict secondary neutron spectra and the energy deposition due to nuclear reactions in silicon pin diodes and the induced radioactivity in the various scintillator crystals. The wide variety of orbital and atmospheric locations enables investigation of the influence of shielding on cosmic ray, trapped proton and solar flare proton spectra.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Group published a consensus definition (the RIFLE criteria) for acute renal failure. We sought to assess the ability of the RIFLE criteria to predict mortality in hospital patients. DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study. SETTING: University-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to the study hospital between January 2000 and December 2002. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 15 yrs old, were on chronic dialysis, or had kidney transplant or if their length of hospital stay was \textbackslash textless24 hrs. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 20,126 patients. Mean age was 64 yrs, 14.7\% of patients required intensive care unit admission, and hospital mortality was 8.0\%. According to the RIFLE criteria, 9.1\% of all patients were in the Risk category for acute renal failure, 5.2\% were in the Injury category, and 3.7\% were in the Failure category. There was an almost linear increase in hospital mortality from Normal to Failure (Normal, 4.4\%; Risk, 15.1\%; Injury, 29.2\%; and Failure, 41.1\%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that all RIFLE criteria were significantly predictive factors for hospital mortality, with an almost linear increase in odds ratios from Risk to Failure (odds ratios, Risk 2.5, Injury 5.4, Failure 10.1). CONCLUSIONS: The RIFLE criteria for acute renal failure classified close to 20\% of our study patients as having some degrees of acute impairment in renal function and were useful in predicting their hospital mortality.},

However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of LSS with PAD (LSSPAD) have not been investigated in a multicenter study. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of LSS associated with PAD. Methods 570 patients diagnosed with LSS using a clinical diagnostic support tool and MRI at 64 facilities were enrolled. We evaluated each patient’s medical history, physical findings, ankle brachial index, Japanese Orthopaedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ) score, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) score. Statistical analyses were performed to compare LSSPAD patients and LSS patients without PAD using the t test, Mann–Whitney’s U test, and multivariate recurrence analysis. p values of {$<$}0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results The LSSPAD group comprised 38 patients (6.7 \%); 20 (3.5 \%) had pre-diagnosised PAD while 18 (3.2 \%) had undetected PAD. The clinical characteristics of these patients were advanced age, diabetes, and a history of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disorder. 570 patients enrolled, and 448 (78.6 \%) of those patients were followed up at three - months after enrollment. Pain in buttocks and legs improved less in the LSSPAD group than in the LSS group (p {$<$} 0.05). Improvements in the “general health” score in SF-36 were lower in the LSSPAD group than in the LSS group (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions Advanced age, diabetes, and a history of cerebrovascular disorder and ischemic heart disease were associated with LSSPAD. Because LSSPAD patients show less improvement in QOL than patients with LSS but without PAD do, clinicians should consider the coexistence of PAD in LSS patients.},

We performed a systematic review of the published studies reporting the safety and efficacy of MitraClip? implantation for treatment of moderate to severe and severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Methods Reviewers independently searched for relevant articles in Medline and abstracted clinical information based on pre-defined criteria and end-points. Patients were classified as low- or high-surgical risk for conventional mitral valve (MV) surgery based on Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, EuroSCORE, or surgeon discretion. Primary safety outcome was 30-day mortality and primary efficacy outcomes were freedom from death, ≥3+ MR, and requirement for MV surgery during follow-up. Results Immediate and long-term outcomes of 16 studies, including 2980 patients (age 73.7?±?0.6 years; 63.3\% males) receiving the MitraClip?, were analyzed. Acute procedural success rate was 91.4\% with a procedural mortality of 0.1\%. Mortality at 30 days and long-term (310 days) follow-up was 4.2 and 15.8\%, respectively and was significantly higher in the high-risk group (P?=?0.003 and 0.019, respectively). Incidence of major procedural adverse outcomes was relatively low with blood transfusion accounting for most events. At follow-up, the number of patients with ≥3+ MR reduced from 96.3\% to 14.7\% (P?},

  abstract = {Aims: We evaluated the feasibility of three-dimensional echocardiography, in the assessment of left atrial appendage (LAA) function. Methods and Results: Forty-five patients underwent multiplane transoesophageal echocardiography. In addition to Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography, data for three-dimensional echocardiography reconstruction were obtained during transoesophageal echocardiography. Left atrial appendage ejection fraction based on three-dimensional echocardiography volume measurements (EFv) and two-dimensional echocardiography area measurements (EFa), coupled with other echocardiographic data, were related to left atrial appendage late peak emptying velocity, a frequently used indicator of left atrial appendage function. Multiple regression analysis has revealed a significant association of peak emptying velocity with EFv ( P \&lt;0·0001), spontaneous echocardiographic contrast ( P =0·001), tricuspid regurgitation ( P =0·03) and left ventricular hypertrophy ( P =0·05). No significant relation was observed between peak emptying velocity and EFa, presence or absence of atrial fibrillation, left ventricular dysfunction, mitral stenosis and insufficiency, left atrial dilatation, pulmonary venous peak systolic, diastolic and peak reverse flow velocity at atrial contraction as well as left atrial appendage volumes derived from two-dimensional echocardiography and three-dimensional echocardiography. In a simple linear correlation, the degree of association between peak emptying velocity and EFv was higher as between peak emptying velocity and EFa (r=0·7 vs 0·4, both P \&lt;0·001). Observer variabilities for calculating EFv were considerably lower than for two-dimensional echocardiography derived EFa. Ejection fractions determined by two-dimensional echocardiography area measurements at 45°, 90° and 135° cutplane angulations were related to EFv only at 135°. Conclusions: Left atrial appendage ejection fraction calculation by three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible, more accurate than by two-dimensional echocardiography and has lower observer variability. Furthermore, an optimal cutplane angulation of the left atrial appendage view at 135° has been demonstrated. Copyright 2002 The European Society of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Objective To test the hypothesis that the use of an automated external defibrillator by police and fire fighters results in higher discharge rates for out of hospital cardiac arrest. Design Controlled clinical trial with initial random allocation of automated external defibrillators to first responders in four of the eight participating regions; each region switched from control to experimental, and vice versa, every four months. Setting Amsterdam and surroundings, the Netherlands. Participants Patients with witnessed out of hospital cardiac arrests, identified by the emergency medical system between January 2000 and January 2002. Main outcomes measures Survival to hospital discharge; return of spontaneous circulation; admission to hospital. Results 243 patients (65\% in ventricular fibrillation) were included in the experimental area and 226 patients (67\% in ventricular fibrillation) in the control area. The median time interval between collapse and first shock was 668 seconds in the experimental area and 769 seconds in the control area (P \&lt; 0.001). 44 (18\%) patients in the experimental area versus 33 (15\%) patients in the control area were discharged (odds ratio 1.3 (95\% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.2), P = 0.33), 139 (57\%) experimental versus 108 (48\%) control patients had return of spontaneous circulation (1.5 (1.0 to 2.2), P = 0.05), and 103 (42\%) experimental versus 74 (33\%) control patients were admitted (1.5 (1.1 to 1.6), P = 0.02). The median delay from receipt of call to dispatch of the ambulance was 120 seconds, and the delay to dispatch of the first responder was 180 seconds. Conclusions Use of automated external defibrillators by first responders did not significantly increase survival to discharge from hospital, although it did improve return of spontaneous circulation and admission to hospital. Improved dispatch procedures should increase the success of programmes of first responders using external defibrillators.},

  abstract = {Objective: Simple guidelines for calculating efficient sample sizes in cluster randomized trials with unknown intraclass correlation (ICC) and varying cluster sizes. Methods: A simple equation is given for the optimal number of clusters and sample size per cluster. Here, optimal means maximizing power for a given budget or minimizing total cost for a given power. The problems of cluster size variation and specification of the ICC of the outcome are solved in a simple yet efficient way. Results: The optimal number of clusters goes up, and the optimal sample size per cluster goes down as the ICC goes up or as the cluster-to-person cost ratio goes down. The available budget, desired power, and effect size only affect the number of clusters and not the sample size per cluster, which is between 7 and 70 for a wide range of cost ratios and ICCs. Power loss because of cluster size variation is compensated by sampling 10\% more clusters. The optimal design for the ICC halfway the range of realistic ICC values is a good choice for the first stage of a two-stage design. The second stage is needed only if the first stage shows the ICC to be higher than assumed. Conclusion: Efficient sample sizes for cluster randomized trials are easily computed, provided the cost per cluster and cost per person are specified. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective, open-label, multicenter European clinical trial was to quantify the efficacy and safety of a spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system that utilizes high-frequency (up to 10 kHz) waveforms, which do not produce paresthesia, for the treatment of chronic, intractable pain of the back and/or limbs.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients, with significant back pain, were recruited for a trial of high-frequency stimulation through two percutaneous eight-contact epidural leads. Patients' pain ratings, disability, sleep disturbances, and satisfaction, as well as complication rates, were assessed for up to six months.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: After a trial period, 88\% (72 out of 82) of patients reported a significant improvement in visual analog scale (VAS) scores and underwent permanent implantation of the high-frequency SCS system. Mean back pain VAS of 8.4 was reduced to 2.7 at six months (p\textbackslash textless 0.001). Mean leg pain VAS of 5.4 was reduced to 1.4 at six months (p\textbackslash textless 0.001). Seventy-four percent of patients had greater than 50\% back pain relief at six months. There were significant improvements in Oswestry disability score and sleep, and reductions in pain medication use. Adverse events observed were those seen with conventional SCS therapy–lead migration, wound infection, and pain around implant site.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with difficult-to-treat chronic back pain, high-frequency SCS provided significant and sustained low back pain and leg pain relief to more than 70\% of treated subjects. Notably, this was achieved without paresthesia. Patients also experienced significant improvement in disability and sleep. Overall, the results confirm a favorable safety and efficacy profile of the high-frequency SCS system.},

Poor reporting hampers the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of a study and the generalisability of its results. Taking into account empirical evidence and theoretical considerations, a group of methodologists, researchers, and editors developed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations to improve the quality of reporting of observational studies. The STROBE Statement consists of a checklist of 22 items, which relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies and four are specific to each of the three study designs. The STROBE Statement provides guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting of observational studies and facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of studies by reviewers, journal editors and readers. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the STROBE Statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item are presented. For each item, one or several published examples and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature are provided. Examples of useful flow diagrams are also included. The STROBE Statement, this document, and the associated Web site (http://www.strobe-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of observational research.},

Saccade deviations have also been used to measure target selection in special populations. Most importantly, recent studies have revealed novel knowledge concerning the spatial tuning and temporal dynamics of target selection in the oculomotor system.

  abstract = {Abstract Background: Survival data from hospital-based or clinical trial studies of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) do not represent survival in community-based settings. Aims: To determine the incidence of CHF and the associated long-term survival in a community-based sample aged ≥57 years and to assess the mortality risk associated with sex and age. Methods: This study was part of the Groningen Longitudinal Aging Study. Results: Annual incidence of CHF per 1000 ranged from 2.5 in middle aged adults (57?60 years) up to 22.4 in older females (≥80 years) and 28.2 in older males (≥80 years). The 1, 2, 5 and 7-year survival rates were 74\%, 65\%, 45\%, 32\% for patients with CHF, compared to 97\%, 94\%, 80\% and 70\% in a matched reference group without CHF. Higher age (≥76 years) was a risk factor for mortality (OR=2.1) and male sex was a risk factor in those aged ≤75 years (OR=1.9) but not for older patients. Conclusion: Long-term survival rates for patients with CHF in the community were worse than the known survival rates from clinical trials. There is a need for studies describing the care of patients with CHF in the community, including the type of care, the provider, the quality of care and the outcome.},

  abstract = {The final months of 2019 witnessed the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 \% limit of detection (LOD95). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was ≥96 \% for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.},

Participants were required to make a speeded saccade toward a predefined target presented concurrently with multiple nontargets and possibly 1 distractor. Target and distractor were either equally salient (Experiments 1 and 2) or not (Experiments 3 and 4). The results uniformly demonstrated that fast eye movements were completely stimulus driven, whereas slower eye movements were goal driven. These results are in line with neither a bottom-up account nor a top-down notion of visual selection. Instead, they indicate that visual selection is the outcome of 2 independent processes, one stimulus driven and the other goal driven, operating in different time windows.},

METHODS--The variability in CBF was measured in 10 nasal mucosal samples from each of 19 normal controls and 23 stable bronchiectatic subjects. RESULTS--The CBF varied at different mucosal sites in both normal subjects and bronchiectatic patients. Although the CBF of the fastest beating cilia was similar in both groups, the CBF of the slowest beating cilia was, on average, lower and showed greater within subject variation in bronchiectatic than in normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS--There is a wide variation in CBF in nasal mucosal samples and this is significantly wider in bronchiectatic subjects with some cilia beating slowly. This may be a consequence of chronic inflammation or infection.},

  abstract = {Background MitraClip is an approved therapy for mitral regurgitation (MR); however, health care resource utilization pre- and post-MitraClip remains understudied. Methods Patients with functional and degenerative MR at high surgical risk in the EVEREST II High-Risk Registry and REALISM Continued-Access Study were linked to Medicare data. Pre- and post-MitraClip all-cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF), and bleeding hospitalizations were identified. Inpatient costs, adjusted to 2010 US dollars, were calculated, and event rate ratios and cost ratios were estimated with multivariable modeling. Results Among 403 linked patients, the mean age was 80 years, 60\% were male, mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was 49.6\%, 83.3\% were New York Heart Association class III/IV, 78.2\% were MR grade 3+/4+, and 63.3\% had functional MR. All-cause hospitalization decreased from 1,854 to 1,435/1,000 person-years (P¡.001). HF hospitalization decreased following MitraClip (749 vs 332/1000 person-years, P¡.001), but bleeding increased (199 vs 298/1000 person-years, P¡.001). Changes in stroke and myocardial infarction were not statistically significant. Overall mean Medicare costs per patient were similar pre- and post-MitraClip, although there was a significant decrease in mean costs among those that survived a full year after MitraClip (18,131 [SD 25,130] vs 11,679 [SD 22,486], P=.02). Conclusions MitraClip was associated with a reduced rate of all-cause and HF hospitalizations and an increased rate of bleeding hospitalizations. One-year Medicare costs were reduced in those who survived a full year after the MitraClip procedure. Payors and providers seeking to reduce HF hospitalizations and associated Medicare costs may consider MitraClip among appropriate patients likely to survive 1 year.}

  abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the risk of cancer (positive predictive value [PPV]) associated with specific findings (mass, calcifications, architectural distortion, asymmetry) in mammographic examinations with abnormal results, to determine the distribution of these findings in examinations in which the patients received a diagnosis of cancer and examinations in which the patients did not, and to analyze PPV variation according to radiologist and patient factors. Materials and Methods: HIPAA-compliant institutional review board approval was obtained. PPV of mammographic findings was evaluated in a prospective cohort of 10~262 women who underwent 10~641 screening or diagnostic mammographic examinations with abnormal results between January 1998 and December 2002 in the San Francisco Mammography Registry. The cohort was linked with the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program to determine cancer status among these women. PPVs were calculated for each finding and were stratified according to patient characteristics, cancer type, and radiologist reader. Results: Cases of breast cancer (n = 1552) were identified (invasive, n = 1287; ductal carcinoma in situ, n = 270); in five, both kinds of breast cancer were recorded. Overall, of the number of interpretations, masses were most frequently noted in 56\%, followed by calcifications in 29\%, asymmetry in 12\%, and architectural distortion in 4\%. Masses, calcifications, architectural distortion, and developing asymmetry demonstrated similar PPVs in screening examinations (9.7\%, 12.7\%, 10.2\%, and 7.4\%, respectively), whereas one-view-only and focal asymmetry demonstrated lower PPVs (3.6\% and 3.7\%, respectively) and were a frequent reason for an abnormal result (42\%). Overall, one (5\%) in 20 invasive cancers was identified with asymmetry, one (6\%) in 16 invasive cancers was identified with architectural distortion, one (21\%) in five invasive cancers was identified with calcifications, and two (68\%) in three invasive cancers were identified with a mass. Conclusion: Five percent of invasive cancers were identified with asymmetry, and asymmetry is more weakly associated with cancer in screening examinations than are mass, calcifications, and architectural distortion. ?

Automated blood pressure (BP) monitors with implemented AF or arrhythmia detection systems may be a useful tool for early diagnosis of AF. A systematic review (Medline/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane) of studies was performed to assess the accuracy of modified BP monitors (for diagnosing AF). A total of five studies (four tests in the physician's office and one at home) were selected. For the most accurate AF detection, three sequential BP measurements should be performed. Direct comparison against a 12-lead ECG showed that the highest sensitivity, 97\% (95\% CI: 94-100\%), for detecting AF was obtained when three readings were assessed with two or three AF-positive readings. The highest specificity (97\%) was obtained when performing three measurements, of which all three must be AF positive. The modified BP monitor (Microlife Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan) has high potential in improving AF screening.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the hemodynamic monitoring capability and safety of a single-use miniaturized transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe left in place in ventilated critically ill patients. METHODS: The probe was inserted in 94 patients and designed to be left in place for up to 72 h. Three views were obtained: the superior vena caval transverse, the mid-esophageal four-chamber, and the transgastric mid-papillary short-axis views. Observational data on the feasibility of insertion, complications, image quality, and influence on management were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: No failure of probe insertion was observed. The nasogastric tube had to be removed in 17 \% of cases. Image quality was judged as adequate or optimal in 91/94 (97 \%) of cases in the superior vena caval view, 89/94 (95 \%) of cases in the four-chamber view, and 86/94 (91 \%) of cases in the short-axis view. The duration of monitoring was 32 ± 23 h, allowing 2.8 ± 1.6 hemodynamic evaluations per patient that led to a mean of 1.4 ± 1.5 therapeutic changes per patient. Among the 263 hemodynamic assessments, 132 (50 \%) had a direct therapeutic impact in 62 patients (66 \%). Two patients developed lip ulceration from the probe, and two patients had self-limited gastric bleeding. CONCLUSION: The single-use miniaturized probe could be inserted in all patients. Image quality was acceptable in the majority of cases, and the information derived from the device was useful in making management decisions in patients with hemodynamic failure on ventilatory support. Further studies are needed to confirm the good tolerance and to compare the new device with other hemodynamic monitoring techniques.},

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case?control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case?control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

However, the results in these studies are conflicting regarding the impact of diabetes on outcome. Hypothesis Diabetes is associated with increased risk of mortality in peripheral artery disease. Methods Using MEDLINE and Scopus, we searched for studies published before January 2016. Additionally, studies were identified by manual search of references of original articles or review studies on this topic. Of the 1072 initially identified records, 21 studies with 15,857 patients were included in the final analysis. Results Diabetes was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio: 1.89, 95\% confidence interval: 1.51-2.35, P {$<$} 0.001), without detected publication bias (Egger bias?=?0.75, P = 0.631). The stronger effect on outcome was obtained in patients with critical limb ischemia (odds ratio: 2.38, 95\% confidence interval: 1.22-4.63, P {$<$} 0.001) as the most severe form of peripheral vascular disease.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assent is an important ethical and legal requirement of paediatric research. Unfortunately, there are significant differences between the guidelines on the details of assent. DISCUSSION: What often remains unclear is the scope of the assent, the procedure for acquiring it, and the way in which children's capacity to assent is determined. There is a general growing tendency that suggests that the process of assent should be personalised, that is, tailored to a particular child. This article supports the idea of personalisation. However, we also propose placing limits on personalisation by introducing a suggested requirement of assent starting at a school-age threshold. In some situations RECs/IRBs and researchers could reduce the suggested threshold. SUMMARY: A recommended age threshold is likely to serve the interests of children better than ambiguous and flexible criteria for personalised age determination.},

  abstract = {Drawing a tree consists of two stages: determining the position of each node, and actually rendering the individuals nodes and interconnecting branches. The algorithm described in this paper is concerned with the first stage: given a list of nodes. an indication of the hierarchical relationship among them. and their shape and size, wrere should each node be positioned for optimal aesthetic effect? This algorithm determines the positions of the nodes for any arbitrary general tree. It is the most desirable positioning with respect to certain widely- accepted heuristics. The positioning, specified in x, y coordinates, minimizes the width of the tree. In a general tree, there is no limit on the number of off- spring per node; this contrasts with binary and ternary trees, for example, which are trees with a limit of 2 and 3 offspring per node. This algorithm oper- ates in time O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Previously, most tree drawings have been positioned by the sure hand of a human graphic designer. Many computer-generated positionings have been either trivial or contained irregularities. Earlier work by Wetherell and Shannon (1979) and Tilford (1981), upon which this algorithm builds, failed to correctly position the interior nodes of some trees. Radack (1988), also building on Tilford's work, has solved this same problem with a different method which makes four passes. The algorithm presented here correctly positions a tree's nodes using only two passes. It also handles several practical considerations: alternate orientations of the tree, variable node sizes, and out-of-bounds conditions.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine the cost effectiveness and cost utility of locating defibrillators in all major airports, railway stations, and bus stations throughout Scotland. Design Economic modelling exercise with data from Heartstart (Scotland). Parameters used in economic model included direct costs derived for increased accident and emergency attendances, increased hospital bed days, purchase and maintenance of defibrillators, and training in their use; life years gained calculated from increased discharges from hospital and mean survival after discharge; utility (quality of life) obtained from published data. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of model. Future gains discounted at 1.5\% a year and future costs at 6\%. Setting Whole of Scotland. Subjects Records of all prehospital cardiac arrests due to presumed heart disease that occurred in a major airport, railway, or bus station between May 1991 and March 1998 and were not witnessed by ambulance or medical staff. Main outcome measures Observed survival to hospital admission and observed survival to discharge. Predicted survival calculated by applying observed survival in patients attended by ambulance staff within three minutes to those who waited longer. Results The total discounted direct costs were £18 325 a year. The cost per life year gained was £29 625 (\$49 625, €;43 151) and the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained was £41 146 (\$68 924, €;59 932). More widespread provision of public place defibrillators would increase these figures. Conclusions The cost per QALY calculated for public place defibrillators represents poorer value for money than some alternative strategies for improving survival after prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest, such as the use of other trained first responders. The figure exceeds the commonly discussed cut off levels for funding in the United Kingdom and United States of £30 000 and \$50 000 per QALY, respectively.},

  abstract = {We describe and compare four different methods for estimating sample size and power, when the primary outcome of the study is a Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measure. These methods are: 1. assuming a Normal distribution and comparing two means; 2. using a non-parametric method; 3. Whitehead's method based on the proportional odds model; 4. the bootstrap. We illustrate the various methods, using data from the SF-36. For simplicity this paper deals with studies designed to compare the effectiveness (or superiority) of a new treatment compared to a standard treatment at a single point in time. The results show that if the HRQoL outcome has a limited number of discrete values (\textbackslash textless 7) and/or the expected proportion of cases at the boundaries is high (scoring 0 or 100), then we would recommend using Whitehead's method (Method 3). Alternatively, if the HRQoL outcome has a large number of distinct values and the proportion at the boundaries is low, then we would recommend using Method 1. If a pilot or historical dataset is readily available (to estimate the shape of the distribution) then bootstrap simulation (Method 4) based on this data will provide a more accurate and reliable sample size estimate than conventional methods (Methods 1, 2, or 3). In the absence of a reliable pilot set, bootstrapping is not appropriate and conventional methods of sample size estimation or simulation will need to be used. Fortunately, with the increasing use of HRQoL outcomes in research, historical datasets are becoming more readily available. Strictly speaking, our results and conclusions only apply to the SF-36 outcome measure. Further empirical work is required to see whether these results hold true for other HRQoL outcomes. However, the SF-36 has many features in common with other HRQoL outcomes: multi-dimensional, ordinal or discrete response categories with upper and lower bounds, and skewed distributions, so therefore, we believe these results and conclusions using the SF-36 will be appropriate for other HRQoL measures.},

We used correlation matrices to compute environmental and genetic disease classifications and corresponding reliability measures.

  abstract = {Purpose Donor specific antibodies (DSA) to mismatched human leukocyte antigens have been reported to adversely affect the outcomes of lung transplantation. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for the development of DSA within 1-year post-transplant and examine its impact on recipients’ medium-term survival. Methods Recipients’ age, type of transplantation (single lung or bilateral lungs), pre-existing antibodies, post-op DSA, method of transplantation (ECMO, off-pump or on-pump), primary graft failure (PGD) grade 3 at 72hrs, blood transfusion, post-op ITU stay, ECMO usage and renal support, and survival status were collected from the unit's database. Binary logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for the development of post-op DSA within 1-year post-transplant. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to identify risk factors for survival. Results From January 2012 to October 2017, 259 adult patients received lung transplantation in our unit and 242 (93.4\%) survived beyond 30-day post-op. Recipients who died within 30-day post-transplant were not included, as the causes of their death were less likely to be influenced by or associated with post-op DSA. Among these 242 recipients, 46 (19.0\%) had pre-existing antibodies and 129 (53.3\%) had DSA detected within 1-year post-transplant. Among all the potential risk factors, transplantation performed with ECMO (p = 0.007, OR 3.06, 95\% CI: 1.36-6.90) are significantly associated with post-op DSA within 1-year post-transplant. Age (p = 0.009, OR 1.03, 95\% CI: 1.01-1.05), post-op renal support (p = 0.015, OR 2.23, 95\% CI: 1.17-4.26), PGD grade 3 at 72hrs (p = 0.001, OR 2.79, 95\% CI: 1.54-5.05), and red blood cell transfusion (p {$<$} 0.001, OR 1.17, 95\% CI: 1.11-1.23) are associated with worse medium-term survival, but neither pre-existing antibodies (p = 0.454) or post-op DSA (p = 0.479) has an impact on survival. Conclusion Use of ECMO for lung transplantation is associated with DSA development within 1-year post-transplantation. However, the presence of DSA within 1-year post-transplant has no impact on medium-term survival in this cohort. Further study is required to look at the effect of DSA on the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction and long-term survival.},

  abstract = {We conducted a randomised controlled trial of mandated five-channel physiological monitoring vs standard care, in acute medical and surgical wards in a single UK teaching hospital. In all, 402 high-risk medical and surgical patients were studied. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients experiencing one or more major adverse events, including urgent staff calls, changes to higher care levels, cardiac arrests or death, in 96 h following randomisation. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients requiring acute treatment changes, and the 30-day and hospital mortality. In the 96 h following randomisation, 113 (56\%) patients in the monitored arm and 116 (58\%) in the control arm (OR 0.94, 95\% CI 0.63-1.40, p = 0.76) had a major event. An acute change in treatment was necessary in 107 (53\%) monitored patients and 101 (50\%) control patients (OR 0.55, 95\% CI 0.87-1.29). Thirty-four (17\%) monitored patients and 35 (17\%) control patients died within 30 days. Thirteen patients in the control group received full five-channel monitoring at the request of the ward staff. We conclude that mandated electronic vital signs monitoring in high risk medical and surgical patients has no effect on adverse events or mortality.},

  abstract = {The technical advances made in microscopy have been matched by an increase in the application of fluorescent microscopy to answer scientific questions. While analysis of fluorescent microscopy images represents a powerful tool, one must be aware of the potential pitfalls. Frequently, the analysis methods applied involve at least some manual steps which are dependent on an observers input. Typically these steps are laborious and time consuming, but more importantly they are also influenced by an individual observer's bias, drift or imprecision. This raises concerns about the repeatability and definitiveness of the reported observations. Using calcium fluorescence in organotypic hippocampal slices as an experimental platform, we demonstrate the influence that manual interventions can exert on an analysis. We show that there is a high degree of variability between observers, and that this can be sufficient to affect the outcome of an experiment. To counter this, and to eliminate the disagreement between observers, we describe an alternative fully automated method which was created using EBImage package for R. This method has the added advantage of being fully open source and customisable, allowing for this approach to be applied to other analyses.},

In this paper, an algorithm is described for the reduction of sporadic noise from a continuous periodic signal. The design can be used where a sample of a periodic signal is required, for example, when an average pulse is needed for pulse wave analysis and characterization. The algorithm is based on cluster analysis for selecting similar repetitions or pulses from a periodic single. This method selects individual pulses without noise, returns a clean pulse signal, and terminates when a sufficiently clean and representative signal is received. The algorithm is designed to be sufficiently compact to be implemented on a microcontroller embedded within a medical device. It has been validated through the removal of noise from an exemplar photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, showing increasing benefit as the noise contamination of the signal increases. The algorithm design is generalised to be applicable for a wide range of physiological (physical) signals.},

However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now generally accepted as the new standard of care for patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis who are not candidates for open surgery. Arguably TAVR may also be a preferred alternative to SAVR in carefully selected high-risk, but still operable, patients in whom morbidity and mortality may be reduced. Although TAVR outcomes continue to improve, concerns remain with respect to vascular injury, stroke, paravalvular regurgitation, and valve durability. However, it seems likely that with ongoing refinement of transcatheter valve systems, techniques, and patient selection TAVR is becoming an increasingly appealing option for a much broader range of patients.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of cuffed tracheal tubes (TTs) in small children is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare post-extubation morbidity and TT exchange rates when using cuffed vs uncuffed tubes in small children. METHODS: Patients aged from birth to 5 yr requiring general anaesthesia with TT intubation were included in 24 European paediatric anaesthesia centres. Patients were prospectively randomized into a cuffed TT group (Microcuff PET) and an uncuffed TT group (Mallinckrodt, Portex, Rüsch, Sheridan). Endpoints were incidence of post-extubation stridor and the number of TT exchanges to find an appropriate-sized tube. For cuffed TTs, minimal cuff pressure required to seal the airway was noted; maximal cuff pressure was limited at 20 cm H(2)O with a pressure release valve. Data are mean (SD). RESULTS: A total of 2246 children were studied (1119/1127 cuffed/uncuffed). The age was 1.93 (1.48) yr in the cuffed and 1.87 (1.45) yr in the uncuffed groups. Post-extubation stridor was noted in 4.4\% of patients with cuffed and in 4.7\% with uncuffed TTs (P=0.543). TT exchange rate was 2.1\% in the cuffed and 30.8\% in the uncuffed groups (P\textbackslash textless0.0001). Minimal cuff pressure required to seal the trachea was 10.6 (4.3) cm H(2)O. CONCLUSIONS: The use of cuffed TTs in small children provides a reliably sealed airway at cuff pressures of \textbackslash textlessor=20 cm H(2)O, reduces the need for TT exchanges, and does not increase the risk for post-extubation stridor compared with uncuffed TTs.},

  abstract = {Importance: Synthetic mesh slings are the most common surgical treatment for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). However, the US Food and Drug Administration has released warnings that question the safety of vaginal mesh.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nObjectives: To measure the incidence of mesh removal or revision after SUI procedures and to determine whether significant surgeon and patient risk factors exist.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nDesign, Setting, and Participants: Population-based retrospective cohort study that included all adult women undergoing an incident procedure for SUI with synthetic mesh in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 2002, through December 31, 2012 (N = 59 887). The end of potential follow-up was March 31, 2013. Data were analyzed from November 1, 2014, through February 28, 2015.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nExposures: Yearly volume of mesh-based procedures for SUI performed by the treating surgeons and their surgical specialty.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMain Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of surgical procedures related to removal or revision of mesh slings (owing to erosion, fistula, pain, or retention). We hypothesized a priori that surgeon volume would be inversely correlated with complications.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nResults: Among the identified 59 887 women who underwent a mesh-based procedure for SUI, the median age was 52 (interquartile range [IQR], 45-63) years. High-volume surgeons (≥75th percentile of yearly mesh-based procedures) were less likely to perform a simultaneous hysterectomy (performed in 11.5\% vs 16.5\% of patients; standardized difference, 0.14), were more likely to work in an academic center (28.9\% vs 16.3\% of patients; standardized difference, 0.30), and saw the patient less frequently in the year before the procedure (median, 2 [IQR, 1-3] vs 3 [IQR, 2-4] visits; standardized difference, 0.26). Complications were treated in 1307 women (2.2\%), and the 10-year cumulative incidence rate was 3.29 (95\% CI, 3.05-3.53). In our multivariable survival model, patients of high-volume surgeons had a significantly lower risk (95\% CI) for experiencing our composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73 [0.65-0.83]; absolute risk reduction, 0.63\% [0.36\%-0.92\%]; P \textbackslash textless .01). Gynecologists were not significantly associated with more complications compared with urologists (HR, 0.94 [95\% CI, 0.83-1.08]; P = .38). Among our secondary exposures of interest, multiple mesh-based SUI procedures increased the risk for complications (HR, 4.73 [95\% CI, 3.62-6.17]; P \textbackslash textless .01). However, traditional high-risk patient features did not increase the risk (HR, 0.58 [95\% CI, 0.08-4.13]; P = .59).\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nConclusions and Relevance: Ten years after SUI mesh surgery, 1 of every 30 women may require a second procedure for mesh removal or revision. Patients of lower-volume surgeons have a 37\% increased likelihood of having a complication. These findings support the recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administration related to the use of vaginal mesh for treatment of SUI.},

  abstract = {The interpretation of NMR images at Aberdeen is most often performed by the individual study of the proton density, difference, inversion recovery and T1 image. This report investigates the usefulness of presenting the information from a pair of images, in this instance the T1 and proton density images, in a single composite image. Information from the two images is combined such that the values from one image are represented by a change in hue (colour), and the values from the other by a change in luminance (intensity). To test the advantages of such combined images, a trial was run using a selection of prediagnosed abnormal brain scans. The information perceived as hue and luminance in the combined images was compared with that from separate conventional monochrome proton density and T1 images. Medical and nonmedical users were told the final diagnosis and were asked whether it was possible to see more, less, or the same information with regard to clinically relevant details in the structure of the abnormality and the image as whole. The results have revealed that for the majority of cases the combined image format can effectively represent the information normally contained in both the monochrome proton density and T1 images—thus speeding up the image viewing process.},

  abstract = {Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major cause of death, yet hypertension commonly goes undetected. Owing to its nature, it is typically asymptomatic until later in its progression when the vessel or organ structure has already been compromised. Therefore, noninvasive and continuous BP measurement methods are needed to ensure appropriate diagnosis and early management before hypertension leads to irreversible complications. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive technology with waveform morphologies similar to that of arterial BP waveforms, therefore attracting interest regarding its usability in BP estimation. In recent years, wearable devices incorporating PPG sensors have been proposed to improve the early diagnosis and management of hypertension. Additionally, the need for improved accuracy and convenience has led to the development of devices that incorporate multiple different biosignals with PPG. Through the addition of modalities such as an electrocardiogram, a final measure of the pulse wave velocity is derived, which has been proved to be inversely correlated to BP and to yield accurate estimations. This paper reviews and summarizes recent studies within the period 2010\&ndash;2019 that combined PPG with other biosignals and offers perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of current developments to guide future advancements in BP measurement. Our literature review reveals promising measurement accuracies and we comment on the effective combinations of modalities and success of this technology.},

This article outlines the evidence included in the Sponsor's submission, the independent critique by the External Assessment Centre (EAC) and the recommendations made by the Medical Technologies Advisory Committee (MTAC). In accordance with the scope issued by NICE, the intervention technology was the indwelling PleurX peritoneal catheter drainage system, the comparator was large-volume paracentesis (LVP; inpatient or outpatient) and the population was patients with treatment-resistant, recurrent malignant ascites. Nine studies (ten papers) were identified with a total of 180 PleurX-treated patients; six were case series with more than four patients that, despite being low in the hierarchy of evidence, provided useful safety information. Technical success of the initial PleurX placement procedure was 100\% across five studies which reported this outcome. One study reported equal complication rates between patients treated with indwelling PleurX catheters (40 patients and 40 catheters) and those receiving repeated LVPs (67 patients and 392 procedures), 7.5\% (3/40; 95\% CI 1.6, 20) and 7.5\% (5/67; 95\% CI 2.2, 15), respectively. All remaining studies were single-arm and reported complication rates of between 0\% and 59\%; this wide range was largely due to variation in the definition of complications and adverse events. Using validated tools, one case series reported improvements in several ascites-related symptoms after placement of the PleurX catheter; however, an overall quality-of-life improvement at 12 weeks was not demonstrated. Positive patient opinions relating to improved symptom control and convenience were reported in a qualitative study. Cost analysis demonstrated that PleurX offered savings to the NHS when compared with repeated LVPs performed in an inpatient setting. This saving of \textbackslash pounds679 per patient was driven primarily by reducing hospital bed days (year 2009-2010 values), but would require 23.5 additional community nurse visits. Advice from clinical experts was that additional home visits were overestimated as many patients would receive such visits regardless of whether a PleurX drain had been fitted. The model demonstrated that PleurX would be more expensive than LVP procedures performed in a setting where one or less hospital bed days were used (e.g. day case or outpatient). There was uncertainty surrounding the number of patients for whom insertion of a PleurX drain would be appropriate as well as the point in the care pathway at which such treatment should be administered. MTAC supported the case for adoption and considered that the available evidence showed PleurX was clinically effective, has low complication rates, can improve quality of life and is less costly than inpatient LVP. In Medical Technology Guidance 9 (MTG9), NICE recommended that PleurX peritoneal catheter drainage system be considered for use in patients with treatment-resistant, recurrent malignant ascites.},

Areas of controversy include the limitation of the QALY approach in terms of the health benefits it can capture, its blindness towards equity concerns, the underlying theoretical assumptions and the most appropriate generic preference-based measure of utility. There is growing debate relating to whether a QALY is the same regardless of who accrues it, and also the issue as to who should value health states. Research is required to further enhance the QALY approach to deal with challenges relating to equity-weighted utility maximization and testing the validity of underlying assumptions.

Results Seventy-eight patients underwent the MitraClip procedure. Their mean age was 77 years, {$>$}50\% had previous cardiac surgery, and 46 had functional MR and 32 degenerative MR. MitraClip devices were successfully placed in 96\% of patients. Protocol-predicted surgical mortality rate in the HRS and concurrent comparator group was 18.2\% and 17.4\%, respectively, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons calculator estimated mortality rate was 14.2\% and 14.9\%, respectively. The 30-day procedure-related mortality rate was 7.7\% in the HRS and 8.3\% in the comparator group (p = NS). The 12-month survival rate was 76\% in the HRS and 55\% in the concurrent comparator group (p = 0.047). In surviving patients with matched baseline and 12-month data, 78\% had an MR grade of ≤2+. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume improved from 172 ml to 140 ml and end-systolic volume improved from 82 ml to 73 ml (both p = 0.001). New York Heart Association functional class improved from III/IV at baseline in 89\% to class I/II in 74\% (p {$<$} 0.0001). Quality of life was improved (Short Form-36 physical component score increased from 32.1 to 36.1 [p = 0.014] and the mental component score from 45.5 to 48.7 [p = 0.065]) at 12 months. The annual rate of hospitalization for congestive heart failure in surviving patients with matched data decreased from 0.59 to 0.32 (p = 0.034). Conclusions The MitraClip device reduced MR in a majority of patients deemed at high risk of surgery, resulting in improvement in clinical symptoms and significant left ventricular reverse remodeling over 12 months.

  abstract = {Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of strokes. Physician screening for AF has been recommended. Home screening for AF may increase the likelihood of detecting asymptomatic AF in patients at risk for stroke because of AF. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and accuracy of screening for AF when taking home blood pressure (BP) measurements using an automatic AF-detecting BP monitor. Subjects aged \textbackslash textgreater64 years or those with hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, or previous stroke were enrolled by their primary physicians and given the AF-BP monitor and an electrocardiographic event monitor to use at home for 30 days. The AF-BP monitor reading was compared with the electrocardiographic reading to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the device for detecting AF. A total of 160 subjects were enrolled, with 10 withdrawing, 1 excluded, and 10 with no AF-BP monitor logs or electrocardiographic recordings. Of the 139 subjects included, 14 had known AF. There was a total of 3,316 days with AF-BP monitor readings and electrocardiographic readings. On the basis of the initial daily AF-BP monitor readings, the AF-BP monitor demonstrated sensitivity of 99.2\% and specificity of 92.9\% for detecting AF. Two subjects with no histories of AF had AF-BP monitor readings of AF that were confirmed by the electrocardiographic monitor. One of these subjects was started on warfarin. In conclusion, home screening for asymptomatic AF while taking BP measurements can be performed accurately. This can be used to detect new AF, allowing treatment with anticoagulation to reduce the future risk for stroke. ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights.},

  abstract = {Screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) by assessing the pulse is recommended in high-risk patients. Some clinical trials demonstrated that the Microlife blood pressure monitor (BPM) with AF detection is more accurate than pulse palpation. This led to a change in practice guidelines in the United Kingdom where AF screening with the Microlife device is recommended instead of pulse palpation. Many BPMs have irregular heart beat detection, but they have not been shown to detect AF reliably. Recently, one study, in a highly select population, suggested that the Omron BPM with irregular heart beat detection has a higher sensitivity for AF than the Microlife BPM. We compared the Microlife and Omron BPMs to electrocardiographic readings for AF detection in general cardiology patients. Inclusion criteria were age ≥50 years without a pacemaker or defibrillator. A total of 199 subjects were enrolled, 30 with AF. Each subject had a 12-lead electrocardiography, 1 Omron BPM reading, and 3 Microlife BPM readings as per device instructions. The Omron device had a sensitivity of 30\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 15.4\% to 49.1\%) with the sensitivity for the first Microlife reading of 97\% (95\% CI 81.4\% to 100\%) and the Microlife readings using the majority rule (AF positive if at least 2 of 3 individual readings were positive for AF) of 100\% (95\% CI 85.9\% to 100\%). Specificity for the Omron device was 97\% (95\% CI 92.5\% to 99.2\%) and for the first Microlife reading of 90\% (95\% CI 83.8\% to 94.2\%) and for the majority rule Microlife device of 92\% (95\% CI 86.2\% to 95.7\%; p \textbackslash textless0.0001). The specificity of both devices is acceptable, but only the Microlife BPM has a sensitivity value that is high enough to be used for AF screening in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Much new evidence has emerged on the importance of blood pressure as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease; the importance of lifestyle measures for the prevention and treatment of hypertension; the efficacy and safety of different drug classes; management of hypertension in groups at higher risk, including people with diabetes; the importance of assessing the total risk of cardiovascular disease; and additional benefits associated with the use of statins. Concern remains that national surveys continue to show substantial underdiagnosis, undertreatment, and poor rates of blood pressure control in the United Kingdom.1 A key reason for this is the predominant use of monotherapy by most doctors.1 To improve this suboptimal treatment, the British Hypertension Society recommends a treatment algorithm based on the AB/CD rule.2 Treatment of blood pressure alone will leave many hypertensive patients at unacceptably high risk of cardiovascular complications and death. This guideline reinforces the view that doctors should not focus solely on blood pressure but must also formally assess total risk of cardiovascular disease and use multifactorial interventions, including statins and aspirin, to reduce it. Most management of blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease will take place in primary care, and these guidelines are intended for general practitioners, practice nurses, and generalists in hospital practice. Detailed advice on implementation and the implications of the national service frameworks and the general medical services contract are contained in the full document (http://www.bhsoc.org/).3 These guidelines have been prepared by the guidelines working party of the British Hypertension Society on behalf of the society. The working party reviewed new data that have become available since the previous guidelines were published4 and amended the recommendations accordingly.

Anatomical optical coherence tomography (aOCT), a novel imaging technique, may overcome these limitations. This study evaluated the accuracy of aOCT against existing techniques in phantom, excised pig and in vivo human airways. Three comparative studies were performed: 1) micrometer-derived area measurements in 10 plastic tubes were compared with aOCT-derived area; 2) aOCT-derived airway compliance curves from excised pig airways were compared with curves derived using an endoscopic technique; and 3) airway dimensions from the trachea to subsegmental bronchi were measured using aOCT in four anaesthetised patients during bronchoscopy and compared with computed tomography (CT) measurements. Measurements in plastic tubes revealed aOCT to be accurate and reliable. In pig airways, aOCT-derived compliance measurements compared closely with endoscopic data. In human airways, dimensions measured with aOCT and CT correlated closely. Bland-Altman plots showed that aOCT diameter and area measurements were higher than CT measurements by 7.6\% and 15.1\%, respectively. Airway measurements using aOCT are accurate, reliable and compare favourably with existing imaging techniques. Using aOCT with conventional bronchoscopy allows real-time measurement of airway dimensions and could be useful clinically in settings where knowledge of airway calibre is required.},

  abstract = {The Microlife(®) 'WatchBP Home A' oscillometric blood pressure monitor detects irregular pulse, suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AF). Early detection of AF can prevent thromboembolic stroke via anticoagulation therapy. The device was considered by the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme of the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The sponsor (Microlife) identified 10 studies. These were reviewed by an External Assessment Centre (EAC) which considered three relevant to the decision problem, including one which found the device detected AF more accurately (sensitivity 96.8 \%, specificity 88.8 \%) than pulse palpation (87.2, 81.3 \%). The EAC concluded the technology had potential to improve detection of AF, but the three studies had uncertain external validity. From a cost-consequence model with a 1-year timeframe, the sponsor calculated the device would reduce electrocardiogram (ECG) referrals and prevent strokes, but incur anticoagulation therapy costs, with net NHS savings of \textbackslash pounds11.6 million and prevention of 221 strokes, annually. The EAC criticised the model for its limited time horizon, and its consideration of symptomatic AF patients who were outside the scope issued by NICE. The EAC applied a de novo Markov model, with a 10-year timeframe. The per use saving was calculated as \textbackslash pounds2.98 for asymptomatic patients aged 65-74 years and \textbackslash pounds4.26 for those aged 75-84 years, with the prevention of 53-117 nonfatal and 28-65 fatal strokes per 100,000 people screened. Following consideration by the NICE Medical Technologies Advisory Committee, NICE judged that the case for adoption was supported by the evidence (Medical Technologies Guidance 13; MTG13).},

This survey aimed to understand the clinical need for new sepsis diagnostics and to identify specific clinical scenarios that could be improved by testing. An electronic, cross-sectional survey was circulated to UK National Health Service (NHS) doctors and nurses who care for patients with suspected sepsis in hospitals. Two hundred and sixty-five participants completed the survey, representing 64 NHS Trusts in England. Sixty-seven percent of respondents suggested that the major cause of delay was during the initial identification of sepsis and the subsequent recognition of patients who were deteriorating. Existing blood tests did not enhance the confidence of consultants making their diagnoses. Those surveyed identified a role for a near-patient test to \&ldquo;rule out\&rdquo; suspected sepsis and, thereby, stop or postpone use of antibiotics. Current diagnostic tests are slow, non-specific, and do not reliably identify patients with a high suspicion of sepsis. As a result, they have a limited use in patient management and antibiotic stewardship. Future development of sepsis diagnostics should focus on overcoming these limitations.},

BACKGROUND: In small randomized trials, PCB angioplasty was superior to uncoated balloon angioplasty for treatment of bare-metal stent (BMS) and drug-eluting stent (DES) restenosis. METHODS: Patients treated with SeQuent Please PCBs were included. The primary outcome measure was the clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate at 9 months. RESULTS: At 75 centers, 2,095 patients with 2,234 lesions were included. The TLR rate was 5.2\% after 9.4 months. Definite vessel thrombosis occurred in 0.1\%. PCB angioplasty was performed in 1,523 patients (72.7\%) with DES or BMS restenosis and 572 patients (27.3\%) with de novo lesions. The TLR rate was significantly lower in patients with PCB angioplasty for BMS restenosis compared with DES restenosis (3.8\% vs. 9.6\%, p \textbackslash textless 0.001). The TLR rate did not differ for PCB angioplasty of paclitaxel-eluting stent and non-paclitaxel-eluting sten restenosis (8.3\% vs. 10.8\%, p = 0.46). In de novo lesions (small vessels), the TLR rate was low and did not differ between PCB angioplasty with and without additional BMS implantation (p = 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: PCB angioplasty in an all-comers, prospective, multicenter registry was safe and confirmed in a large population the low TLR rates seen in randomized clinical trials. PCB angioplasty was more effective in BMS restenosis compared with DES restenosis, with no difference regarding the type of DES.},

In this investigation, we assess how scene characteristics contribute to these fixation dynamics. In a free-viewing task, participants viewed three scene types: fractal, landscape, and social scenes. We used a relatively new method, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), to quantify eye movement dynamics. RQA revealed that eye movement dynamics were dependent on the scene type viewed. To understand the underlying cause for these differences we applied a technique known as fractal analysis and discovered that complexity and clutter are two scene characteristics that affect fixation dynamics, but only in scenes with meaningful content. Critically, scene primitives—revealed by saliency analysis—had no impact on performance. In addition, we explored how RQA differs from the first half of the trial to the second half, as well as the potential to investigate the precision of fixation targeting by changing RQA radius values. Collectively, our results suggest that eye movement dynamics result from top- down viewing strategies that vary according to the meaning of a scene and its associated visual complexity and clutter},

  abstract = {Despite improved treatment, a significant number of diabetic foot ulcers do not heal and eventually lead to amputation (1–5). The important local factors determining the healing rate of ulcers are pressure at the site of the ulcer, adequacy of blood supply, and infection. It is generally accepted that for optimal healing, infection needs to be treated. However, the definition of infection is arbitrary, and, in many borderline cases, clinicians will be uncertain whether antibiotic therapy is indicated. Edmonds et al. (6) showed, in a study of clinically uninfected diabetic foot ulcers, that, even in the absence of overt infection, antibiotic therapy reduced hospitalization and amputation. Conceptually, a high bacterial load by itself can retard ulcer healing by causing a wound environment not conducive to healing. Important factors that may play a role in this regard include secretion of metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors from the bacteria, compounds that can cause local tissue destruction (7). Little is known, however, about the effect of bacterial load on the healing rate of neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers. In this study, instead of arbitrarily deciding clinically whether infection was present, a quantitative microbiological method was used to examine the relationship between bacterial load in the wounds of diabetic neuropathic ulcers and the subsequent ulcer healing rate. Wound fluid was obtained from 32 patients (22 male and 10 female) with neuropathic ulcers at the plantar surface of the foot. Patients were referred to the High Risk Diabetic Foot Clinic at the Diabetes Centre of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia. The mean ± SD age of the cohort was 60.0 ± 9.0 years with a diabetes duration of 14.6 ± 10.1 years and an A1C of 7.9 ± 1.4\% (normal \&lt;6.0\%).

  abstract = {Background. The cell type responsible for the desmoplastic reaction surrounding human pancreatic carcinoma is unknown. Hepatic stellate cells, which activate to a myofibroblast-like form, are responsible for collagen deposition in cirrhosis and around hepatocellular carcinomas. Recently, pancreatic stellate cells have been described and implicated in the fibrosis of chronic pancreatitis. We sought to determine whether these cells are responsible for the scirrhous reaction surrounding pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Methods. Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissues from 10 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma and from 2 patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors were examined immunohistochemically for alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), procollagen I, collagen IV, and endothelial cell markers, von Willebrand factor and cluster of differentiation 31. Results. In non-neoplastic areas, staining for α-SMA and SMMHC was confined to interlobular septal regions. In contrast, the desmoplastic reaction surrounding all 10 pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens displayed intense interstitial staining for α-SMA, SMMHC, and collagen IV but no staining for von Willebrand factor and cluster of differentiation 31. Procollagen I staining localized intracellularly to fibroblast-shaped cells within this α-SMA/SMMHC-positive scirrhous region. Islet cell tumors demonstrated an increase in α-SMA staining, although this was not as marked as in ductal adenocarcinomas. Conclusions. A massive increase in myofibroblast activity, compatible with the activation of stellate cells, is associated with the deposition of collagen types I and IV in the desmoplastic reaction around pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

By means of the FFT power spectrum, maximum peak frequencies are detected as CBFs in each partitioned block for the entire digitised field. Using these CBFs, distribution maps are composed in various resolutions, showing visually the spatial distribution of CBFs through cells and in a single cell. To measure CBF variations quantitatively, phenylephrine hydrochloride is used, and the changes in CBF influenced by its concentration and duration are observed.},

But while observational techniques have greatly advanced in the last century, techniques for perturbation that are matched to the speed and heterogeneity of neural systems have lagged behind. The technology of optogenetics represents a step toward addressing this disparity. Reliable and targetable single-component tools (which encompass both light sensation and effector function within a single protein) have enabled versatile new classes of investigation in the study of neural systems. Here we provide a primer on the application of optogenetics in neuroscience, focusing on the single-component tools and highlighting important problems, challenges, and technical considerations.},

For each ventricle, a 4-D model was first used to achieve robust preliminary segmentation on all cardiac phases simultaneously and a 3-D model was then applied to each phase to improve local accuracy while maintaining the overall robustness of the 4-D segmentation. On 25 normal and 25 TOF hearts, in comparison to the expert traced independent standard, our comprehensive performance assessment showed subvoxel segmentation accuracy, high overlap ratios, good ventricular volume correlations, and small percent volume differences. Following 4-D segmentation, novel quantitative shape and motion features were extracted using shape information, volume-time and dV/dt curves, analyzed and used for disease status classification. Automated discrimination between normal/TOF subjects achieved 90\%-100\% sensitivity and specificity. The features obtained from TOF hearts show higher variability compared to normal subjects, suggesting their potential use as disease progression indicators. The abnormal shape and motion variations of the TOF hearts were accurately captured by both the segmentation and feature characterization.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Interrupted time series is a strong quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the impacts of health policy interventions. Using simulation methods, we estimated the power requirements for interrupted time series studies under various scenarios. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Simulations were conducted to estimate the power of segmented autoregressive (AR) error models when autocorrelation ranged from -0.9 to 0.9 and effect size was 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0, investigating balanced and unbalanced numbers of time periods before and after an intervention. Simple scenarios of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models were also explored. RESULTS: For AR models, power increased when sample size or effect size increased, and tended to decrease when autocorrelation increased. Compared with a balanced number of study periods before and after an intervention, designs with unbalanced numbers of periods had less power, although that was not the case for ARCH models. CONCLUSION: The power to detect effect size 1.0 appeared to be reasonable for many practical applications with a moderate or large number of time points in the study equally divided around the intervention. Investigators should be cautious when the expected effect size is small or the number of time points is small. We recommend conducting various simulations before investigation.},

In this research, different techniques were studied and compared with the auscultatory technique. Auscultatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) were obtained in 55 healthy subjects by two trained observers, and auscultatory MAP was estimated. Automated MAP was determined by six techniques from oscillometric cuff pressures recorded digitally and simultaneously during manual measurement. MAPs were derived from the peak and foot of the largest oscillometric pulse, and from time domain curves fitted to the sequence of oscillometric pulse amplitudes (4th order and three versions of the 6th order polynomial curve). The agreement between automated and auscultatory MAPs was assessed. Compared with the auscultatory MAP, the automated MAP from the baseline cuff pressure at the peak of the 6th order polynomial curve had the smallest mean paired difference (-1.0 mmHg), and smallest standard deviation of paired differences (3.7 mmHg). These values from the peak of the largest oscillometric pulse were -1.3 and 6.2 mmHg, respectively. Determining MAP from a model of the oscillometric pulse waveform had the smallest differences from the manual auscultatory technique.},

Oscillometric pulses recorded from 75 subjects at the recommended deflation rate of 2-3 mmHg per second were analyzed. Some pulses were removed to realize six faster rates (2-7 times faster than the original). Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures (SBP, DBP, MAP) were determined from the original and six reconstructed oscillometric waveforms. Manual measurement was based on the appearance of oscillometric pulse peaks, and automatic measurement on two model envelopes (linear and polynomial) fitted to the sequence of oscillometric pulse amplitudes. The effects of deflation rate on BP determination and within-subject BP variability were analyzed. For SBP and DBP determined from the manual measurement, different deflation rates resulted in significant changes (both p \textbackslash textless 0.001). However, for SBP, DBP, and MAP determined from the automatic linear and polynomial model techniques, there was no deflation rate effect (all p \textbackslash textgreater 0.3). Faster deflation increased the within-subject BP variability (all p \textbackslash textless 0.001). In conclusion, for the manual technique accurate BP measurement could be achieved only with the recommended slow deflation rate, and for the automatic model-based techniques, the deflation rate had little effect.},

Arterial transmural pressures on the whole right arm were reduced with a 50 cm long cuff inflated to 10, 20, 30 and 40 mmHg. The electrocardiogram, and finger and ear photoplethysmograms were recorded simultaneously. Arm pulse propagation time, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and arterial volume distensibility were determined. With a 40 mmHg reduction in transmural pressure, arm pulse propagation time increased from 61 to 83 ms, PWV decreased from 12 to 8 m s(-1) and arterial distensibility increased from 0.102\% to 0.232\% per mmHg (all P \textbackslash textless 0.0001). At all cuff pressures, arterial distensibility was significantly related to resting mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and age, and for systolic blood pressure at 30 and 40 mmHg (all P \textbackslash textless 0.05). At 40 mmHg cuff pressure, arterial distensibility fell by 54\% for a MAP increase from 75 to 105 mmHg, 57\% for a DBP increase from 60 to 90 mmHg and 47\% for an age increase from 20 to 70 years. These changes were more than double than those without cuff pressure. Our technique showed that systemic volume distensibility of the peripheral arm artery reduced with age, with a greater effect at higher external and lower transmural pressures.},

  abstract = {Statistical models have shown considerable promise as a basis for segmenting and interpreting cardiac images. While a variety of statistical models have been proposed to improve the segmentation results, most of them are either static models (SMs), which neglect the temporal dynamics of a cardiac sequence, or generic dynamical models (GDMs), which are homogeneous in time and neglect the intersubject variability in cardiac shape and deformation. In this paper, we develop a subject-specific dynamical model (SSDM) that simultaneously handles temporal dynamics (intrasubject variability) and intersubject variability. We also propose a dynamic prediction algorithm that can progressively identify the specific motion patterns of a new cardiac sequence based on the shapes observed in past frames. The incorporation of this SSDM into the segmentation framework is formulated in a recursive Bayesian framework. It starts with a manual segmentation of the first frame, and then segments each frame according to intensity information from the current frame as well as the prediction from past frames. In addition, to reduce error propagation in sequential segmentation, we take into account the periodic nature of cardiac motion and perform segmentation in both forward and backward directions. We perform "leave-one-out" test on 32 canine sequences and 22 human sequences, and compare the experimental results with those from SM, GDM, and active appearance motion model (AAMM). Quantitative analysis of the experimental results shows that SSDM outperforms SM, GDM, and AAMM by having better global and local consistencies with manual segmentation. Moreover, we compare the segmentation results from forward and forward-backward segmentation. Quantitative evaluation shows that forward-backward segmentation suppresses the propagation of segmentation errors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Results from an observational study involving neonates suggested that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), as compared with conventional ventilation, was associated with superior small-airway function at follow-up. Data from randomized trials are needed to confirm this finding. METHODS: We studied 319 adolescents who had been born before 29 weeks of gestation and had been enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial that compared HFOV with conventional ventilation immediately after birth. The trial involved 797 neonates, of whom 592 survived to hospital discharge. We compared follow-up data from adolescents who had been randomly assigned to HFOV with follow-up data from those who had been randomly assigned to conventional ventilation, with respect to lung function and respiratory health, health-related quality of life, and functional status, as assessed with the use of questionnaires completed when the participants were 11 to 14 years of age. The primary outcome was forced expiratory flow at 75\% of the expired vital capacity (FEF75). RESULTS: The HFOV group had superior results on a test of small-airway function (z score for FEF75, -0.97 with HFOV vs. -1.19 with conventional therapy; adjusted difference, 0.23 [95\% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.45]). There were significant differences in favor of HFOV in several other measures of respiratory function, including forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow, diffusing capacity, and impulse-oscillometric findings. As compared with the conventional-therapy group, the HFOV group had significantly higher ratings from teachers in three of eight school subjects assessed, but there were no other significant differences in functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial involving children who had been born extremely prematurely, those who had undergone HFOV, as compared with those who had received conventional ventilation, had superior lung function at 11 to 14 years of age, with no evidence of poorer functional outcomes.

  abstract = {Purpose: The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) is widely used and accepted into adult clinical practice. The present study was initiated to adapt the VHI to the pediatric population and to validate it in the form of a parental proxy. Methods: The initial modification of the adult VHI involved changing the language of the statements to reflect a parent's responses about their child and eliminating questions that would not relate to children. It was administered in conjunction with 10 open-ended questions regarding the impact of the child's voice quality on overall communication, development, education, social and family life. The pVHI was then modified in content and language, and the final 23-item parental proxy product was used for the validation process. The modified pVHI was administered to two groups of patients following IRB approval from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Results: Normative data was obtained from 45 parents of healthy children. The group consisted of 21 males, age ranges 3-12 years old. The mean scores of the total pVHI and its subscales are: functional (F) 1.47, physical (P) 0.20, emotional (E) 0.18 and total (T) 1.84. The test group consisted of 33 guardians of children presenting for a voice evaluation pre- or post-laryngotracheal reconstruction. This group differed greatly from the control group on each subscale and total score. The mean scores of the airway group were as follows: F 13.94, P 15.48, E 12.15 and T 41.58. Test-retest reliability of the total pVHI score was measured using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The scores were 0.95, 0.77, 0.79 and 0.82, respectively. A correlation matrix for pVHI subscore and total score showed significance, with results similar to those reported for the original adult VHI. Conclusions: The aim of the present study was to modify the VHI to serve a similar role in the evaluation of the effects of dysphonia on the pediatric population. The statistical results reveal a high correlation between the VHI and the pVHI. The pVHI provides a high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. This tool will be utilized to follow a child's development following surgical, medical and behavioral interventions. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

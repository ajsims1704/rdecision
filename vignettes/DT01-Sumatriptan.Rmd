# Introduction
This vignette is an example of modelling a decision tree using the `rdecision`
package. It is based on the example given by Briggs [-@briggs2006] (Box 2.3) 
which itself is based on a decision tree which compared oral Sumatriptan versus
oral caffeine/Ergotamine for migraine [@evans1997].

# Creating the model

## Constructing the tree
The following code constructs the decision tree. In the
formulation used by `rdecision`, a decision tree is a form of
*arborescence*, a directed graph of nodes and edges, with a single
root and a unique path from the root to each leaf node. Decision trees
comprise three types of node: decision, chance and leaf nodes and two
types of edge: actions (whose sources are decision nodes) and reactions
(whose sources are chance nodes), [see figure](#tree-diagram).

## Tree diagram
```{r caption, echo=FALSE}
f1c  <- "Decision tree for the Sumatriptan model"
```
```{r draw,echo=FALSE,results="hide",fig.keep="all",fig.align="center",fig.cap=f1c}
DT$draw(border=TRUE)
```

# Running the model
The method `evaluate` of decision tree objects computes
the probability, cost and utility of each *strategy* for the model. A strategy
is a unanimous prescription of the actions at each decision node. In this
example there is a single decision node with two actions, and the strategies
are simply the two forms of treatment to be compared. More complex decision
trees are also possible.

The paths traversable in each strategy can be evaluated individually
using the method `evaluate(by="path")`. In `rdecision` a strategy is defined as
a set of action edges with one action edge per decision node. It is necessary to 
use the option `by="path"` only if information about each pathway is
required; normally it is sufficient to call `evaluate` which will automatically
aggregate the evaluation by strategy.

# Model results
The evaluation of each pathway, for each strategy, yields the following table:
```{r echo=FALSE}
local({
  RES <- DT$evaluate(by="path")
  RES$Benefit <- NULL
  RES$Run <- NULL
  knitr::kable(RES, row.names = FALSE, digits = c(NA, NA, 2L, 2L, 2L, 4L))
})
```

There are, as expected, ten pathways (5 per strategy). The expected
cost, utility and QALY (utility multiplied by the time horizon of the model) for
each choice can be calculated from the table 
above, or by invoking the `evaluate` method of a decision tree object with the
default parameter `by="strategy"`. This gives the following result, consistent
with that reported by Evans *et al* [-@evans1997].

```{r echo=FALSE}
local({
  SUM <- DT$evaluate()
  SUM$Run <- NULL
  SUM$Probability <- NULL
  SUM$Benefit <- NULL
  knitr::kable(SUM, row.names = FALSE, digits = c(NA, 2L, 5L, 5L))
})
```

  abstract = {A model's purpose is to inform medical decisions and health care resource allocation. Modelers employ quantitative methods to structure the clinical, epidemiological, and economic evidence base and gain qualitative insight to assist decision makers in making better decisions. From a policy perspective, the value of a model-based analysis lies not simply in its ability to generate a precise point estimate for a specific outcome but also in the systematic examination and responsible reporting of uncertainty surrounding this outcome and the ultimate decision being addressed. Different concepts relating to uncertainty in decision modeling are explored. Stochastic (first-order) uncertainty is distinguished from both parameter (second-order) uncertainty and from heterogeneity, with structural uncertainty relating to the model itself forming another level of uncertainty to consider. The article argues that the estimation of point estimates and uncertainty in parameters is part of a single process and explores the link between parameter uncertainty through to decision uncertainty and the relationship to value of information analysis. The article also makes extensive recommendations around the reporting of uncertainty, in terms of both deterministic sensitivity analysis techniques and probabilistic methods. Expected value of perfect information is argued to be the most appropriate presentational technique, alongside cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, for representing decision uncertainty from probabilistic analysis.},

  abstract = {Summary Between October 1997 and June 2001, 140 English hospitals participating in the surveillance of surgical site infection (SSI) with the Nosocomial Infection National Surveillance Service (NINSS) reported 2832 SSIs following 67\hphantom{,}410 surgical procedures in nine defined categories of surgery. Limb amputation had the highest incidence of SSI with 14.3 SSIs per 100 operations. For all categories of surgery, except knee prosthesis (P=0.128), there was a linear increase in the incidence of SSI when the American National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance risk index increased. Superficial incisional SSI was more common than deep incisional and organ/space SSI, and accounted for more than half of all SSIs for all categories of surgery. The postoperative length of stay (LOS) was longer for patients with SSI, and when adjusted for other factors influencing LOS, the extra LOS due to SSI ranged from 3.3 days for abdominal hysterectomy to 21.0 days for limb amputation, and was at least nine days for the other categories. The additional cost attributable to SSI ranged from £959 for abdominal hysterectomy to £6103 for limb amputation. Deep incisional and organ/space SSI combined incurred a greater extra LOS and cost than superficial incisional SSI for all categories of surgery, except limb amputation. The crude mortality rate was higher for patients with SSI for all categories of surgery but, after controlling for confounding, only patients with SSI following hip prosthesis had a mortality rate that was significantly higher than those without SSI [odds ratio (OR)=1.8, P=0.002]. However, the adjusted mortality rate for patients with deep incisional and organ/space SSI compared with those without SSI was significantly higher for vascular surgery (OR=6.8, P{$<$}0.001), hip prosthesis (OR=2.5, P=0.005) and large bowel surgery (OR=1.8, P=0.04). This study shows that the adverse impact of SSI differs greatly for different categories of surgery, and highlights the importance of measuring the impact for defined categories rather than for all SSIs and all surgical procedures.},

  abstract = {Objectives To compare the expected costs and outcomes of seven alternative long-term primary care strategies for the management of patients with moderate-to-severe heartburn over a 1-year period. Methods A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate costs and effects (weeks with heartburn symptoms and quality adjusted life years QALYs]) for each strategy. Meta-analyses were used to synthesize acute treatment and maintenance studies and physician surveys to collect information on patient management. The impact of uncertainty on the base case results was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Probability distributions were defined for key model parameters and techniques of Monte Carlo simulation were used to draw values from these distributions. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) conditional on the monetary value decision makers are willing to pay for a symptom-free day or QALY were created for each strategy. Results In the base case, no strategy was strictly dominated by any other strategy. However, two strategies (maintenance H2-receptor antagonists H2RA] and step-down proton pump inhibitor PPI]) were dominated through principles of extended dominance. The least costly and least effective strategy was intermittent H2RA, while maintenance PPI was the most costly and most effective. Conclusions This analysis showed that the best way of managing patients with heartburn depends on how much society is willing to pay to achieve health improvements. Based on the commonly quoted threshold of \$50,000 per QALY, the optimal primary care strategy for managing patients with moderate-to-severe heartburn symptoms is to treat the symptoms with a PPI followed by maintenance therapy with an H2RA to prevent symptomatic recurrence.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Despite several randomized trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have demonstrated the effectiveness of antimicrobial (triclosan-coated or -impregnated) sutures (TCS), the clinical and economic impact of using these sutures compared with conventional non-antimicrobial-coated absorbable sutures (NCS) remains poorly documented. Methods An independent systematic review and meta-analysis of all published evidence from January 2005 to September 2016 comparing TCS with NCS was conducted. Surgical-site infection (SSI) was the primary outcome. The results of the meta-analysis were used in a decision-tree deterministic and stochastic cost model, using the National Health Service (NHS England)-based cost of inpatient admissions for infections and differential costs of TCS versus NCS. Results Thirty-four studies were included in the final assessment from an initial 163 identified citations; 20 of 34 studies were randomized, and 17 of 34 reported blinding of physicians and assessors. Using a random-effects model, the odds ratio for SSI in the TCS compared with NCS control groups was statistically significant (odds ratio 0·61, 95 per cent c.i. 0·52 to 0·73; P {$<$} 0·001). There was significant heterogeneity (I2 = 49 per cent). Using random-effects event estimates of SSI for TCS and NCS for each individual wound type, the mean savings per surgical procedure from using antimicrobial sutures were significant: £91·25 (90 per cent c.i. 49·62 to 142·76) (?105·09 (57·15 to 164·41); exchange rate 15 November 2016) across all wound types. Conclusion The reviewed literature suggested that antimicrobial sutures may result in significant savings across various surgical wound types.},

  abstract = {Drawing a tree consists of two stages: determining the position of each node, and actually rendering the individuals nodes and interconnecting branches. The algorithm described in this paper is concerned with the first stage: given a list of nodes. an indication of the hierarchical relationship among them. and their shape and size, wrere should each node be positioned for optimal aesthetic effect? This algorithm determines the positions of the nodes for any arbitrary general tree. It is the most desirable positioning with respect to certain widely- accepted heuristics. The positioning, specified in x, y coordinates, minimizes the width of the tree. In a general tree, there is no limit on the number of off- spring per node; this contrasts with binary and ternary trees, for example, which are trees with a limit of 2 and 3 offspring per node. This algorithm oper- ates in time O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Previously, most tree drawings have been positioned by the sure hand of a human graphic designer. Many computer-generated positionings have been either trivial or contained irregularities. Earlier work by Wetherell and Shannon (1979) and Tilford (1981), upon which this algorithm builds, failed to correctly position the interior nodes of some trees. Radack (1988), also building on Tilford's work, has solved this same problem with a different method which makes four passes. The algorithm presented here correctly positions a tree's nodes using only two passes. It also handles several practical considerations: alternate orientations of the tree, variable node sizes, and out-of-bounds conditions.},

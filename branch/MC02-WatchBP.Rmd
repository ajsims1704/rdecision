# Introduction
This vignette describes a Markov model that was used to evaluate the cost 
consequences of opportunistic screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) during
clinic visits involving blood pressure measurement. It was first developed
for the assessment of the WatchBP oscillometric blood pressure measurement
device by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
[@willits2014a] and is described fully in a report that was published during
the guidance development process [@willits2012a].

The guidance report followed two cohorts, those aged 65-74 and those aged 
75-84, to account for the age dependency in risk of AF. This vignette
focuses on the older cohort.

# Diagnostic phase
```{r tree-vars, echo=FALSE}
# sens and spec of index and comparator tests
Sn.I <- 0.967
Sp.I <- 0.888
Sn.C <- 0.872
Sp.C <- 0.813
# prevalence
prev <- 0.072
# cohort size
N <- 100000
```
The diagnostic phase was modelled as a decision tree in which the
diagnostic
test accuracies of the index technology (WatchBP) and the comparator technology 
(pulse palpation) were used to estimate the proportions of the cohort falling
into the true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP) and false
negative (FN) categories. These proportions were used to define the starting
populations in the management phase (a Markov model) with a cohort size 
of `r N`. In the diagnostic phase the prevalance of AF was `r prev`; WatchBP 
had a sensitivity of `r Sn.I` and a specificity of `r Sp.I`; pulse palpation had 
a sensitivity of `r Sn.C` and a specificity of `r Sp.C`.

## Model structure
A Markov model was constructed with six states (Fig 1): AF, GI bleed, stroke
(year 1), stroke (subsequent years), fatal stroke and dead. The GI bleed state 
was a tunnel state, which patients occupied for 1 cycle before returning to the
AF state. Patients in this state have AF, and thus the same risk of stroke and
death as patients in the AF state. The fatal stroke and dead states were
absorbing states. The stroke 
in year 1 had no self loop and thus a maximum occupancy of 1 cycle. The 
transition rates and costs that will be set for each cohort are set to zero
when each edge is created.

```{r cm, echo=TRUE}
# AF state
AF <- MarkovState$new("AF")
# disease states
GB <- MarkovState$new("GIbleed")
S1 <- MarkovState$new("StrokeY1")
SN <- MarkovState$new("StrokeY2+")
SF <- MarkovState$new("FatalStroke")
DD <- MarkovState$new("Dead")
# transitions from AF
e.AFAF <- MarkovTransition$new(AF, AF, r=NULL)
e.AFGB <- MarkovTransition$new(AF, GB, r=0)

e.S1SF <- MarkovTransition$new(S1, SF, r=0)
e.S1DD <- MarkovTransition$new(S1, DD, r=0)
# transitions from stroke, subsequent years

  hcc = FALSE,
  tcycle = as.difftime(365.25/12, units="days")

```

```{r caption, echo=FALSE}
f1c  <- paste("Figure 1. Markov model for management of atrial fibrillation")
```
```{r draw, fig.cap=f1c}
DOT <- CM$as_DOT()
writeLines(DOT, con="WatchBP.gv")
system2(command="dot", args=c("-Tpng","-o","WatchBP.png","WatchBP.gv"))
knitr::include_graphics(path="WatchBP.png")
```

## Cohorts
The model was run for several sub-cohorts, each defined by their CHADS2 score 
and medication. The variables used in the model were: the annual probability of
a major GI bleed due to aspirin or oral anticoagulant medication (`pB`); the
annual probability of a stroke, based on CHADS2 risk (`pS`); the annual 
probability of death due to all causes (`SMR`) for the age at the centre of the
range; the proportion of strokes that are fatal in the first year (`pF1`); the
proportion of strokes that are fatal in subsequent years (`pFN`) and the relative
risk of stroke associated with medication (`rr.S`). These are shown in
the table below (probabilities shown as percentages).

```{r print-cohorts, echo=FALSE}
pander::pander(
  COHORT,
  caption = "Characteristics of each sub-cohort."
)
```

## An example cohort
The transition rates were computed from the annual transition probabilities
and set for each cohort. To illustrate, for patients in the the 75-84 year
cohort with a CHADS2 score of 2 and who were treated with anticoagulant, the
rates were set as follows:
```{r egcohort, echo=TRUE}
idx <- 4
e.AFGB$set_rate(-log(1-COHORT[idx,"pB"]/100))
e.AFDD$set_rate(-log(1-COHORT[idx,"SMR"]/100))
p.stroke <- (COHORT[idx,"pS"]/100) * COHORT[idx,"rr.S"]
r.stroke <- -log(1-p.stroke)/1
e.AFS1$set_rate(r.stroke)
e.GBS1$set_rate(r.stroke)
e.GBDD$set_rate(-log(1-COHORT[idx,"SMR"]/100))
e.S1SF$set_rate(-log(1-COHORT[idx,"pF1"]/100))
e.S1DD$set_rate(-log(1-COHORT[idx,"SMR"]/100))
e.SNSF$set_rate(-log(1-COHORT[idx,"pFN"]/100))
e.SNDD$set_rate(-log(1-COHORT[idx,"SMR"]/100))
```

The per-cycle (annual) transition probability matrix for this cohort is as 
follows:
```{r tm, echo=FALSE}
TM <- CM$transition_probability()
TM <- cbind(TM, rowSums(TM))
pander::pander(TM, emphasize.rownames=FALSE) #, justify="lcccccc")
rm(TM)
```

Over ten years, the Markov trace is as follows:
```{r egcohort-trace, echo=FALSE}
# set the population
pop <- CM$get_populations()
pop["AF"] <- 100000
CM$set_populations(pop)
# run 10 cycles
MT <- CM$cycles(ncycles=10*12)
# cumulative totals
CT <- data.frame(
  Years = MT$Years,
  GIbleed = cumsum(MT$GIbleed),
  Stroke = cumsum(MT$StrokeY1),
  FatalStroke = MT$FatalStroke
)
MT <- rbind(MT, colSums(MT))
# print it
pander::pander(MT)
```

```{r egcohort-cumulative, echo=FALSE}
# print it
pander::pander(CT)
```

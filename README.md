The goal of `rdecision` is to provide methods for assessing health care
interventions using cohort models (decision trees and semi-Markov models) which
can be constructed using only a few lines of R code. Mechanisms
are provided for associating an uncertainty distribution with each source
variable and for ensuring transparency of the mathematical relationships between
variables. The package terminology follows Briggs *et al* “Decision Modelling
for Health Economic Evaluation”<sup>1</sup>.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rdecision from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rdecision")
```

## Examples

### A decision tree with parameter uncertainty

Consider the fictitious and idealized decision problem of choosing between
providing two forms of lifestyle advice, offered to people with vascular
disease, which reduce the risk of needing an interventional procedure. It is
assumed that the interventional procedure is the insertion of a stent, that
the current standard of care is the provision of dietary advice, and that the
new form of care is enrolment on an exercise programme. To assess the decision
problem, we construct a model from the perspective of a healthcare provider,
with a time horizon of one year, and assume that the utility of both forms
of advice is equal. The model evaluates the incremental benefit of the
exercise programme as the incremental number of interventional procedures
avoided against the incremental cost of the exercise programme.

The cost to a healthcare provider of the interventional procedure
(e.g., inserting a stent) is 5000 GBP; the cost of providing the current form of
lifestyle advice, an appointment with a dietician (“diet”), is 50 GBP and the
cost of providing an alternative form, attendance at an exercise
programme (“exercise”), is 750 GBP. None of the costs are subject to
uncertainty, and are modelled as constant model variables.

``` r
cost_diet <- ConstModVar$new("Cost of diet programme", "GBP", 50.0)
cost_exercise <- ConstModVar$new("Cost of exercise programme", "GBP", 750.0)
cost_stent <- ConstModVar$new("Cost of stent intervention", "GBP", 5000.0)
```

If an advice programme is successful, there is no need for an interventional
procedure. In a small trial of the “diet” programme, 12 out of 68 patients
(17.6%) avoided having a procedure, and in a separate small trial of the
“exercise” programme 18 out of 58 patients (31.0%) avoided the procedure. It
is assumed that the baseline characteristics in the two trials were comparable.
The trial results are represented as scalar integers.

``` r
s_diet <- 12L
f_diet <- 56L
s_exercise <- 18L
f_exercise <- 40L
```

The proportions of the two programmes being successful (i.e., avoiding
an interventional procedure) are uncertain due to the finite size of each trial
and are represented by model variables with uncertainties which follow Beta
distributions. Probabilities of the failure of the programmes are calculated
using expression model variables to ensure that the total probability
associated with each chance node is one.

``` r
p_diet <- BetaModVar$new(
  alpha = s_diet, beta = f_diet, description = "P(diet)", units = ""
)
p_exercise <- BetaModVar$new(
  alpha = s_exercise, beta = f_exercise, description = "P(exercise)", units = ""
)

q_diet <- ExprModVar$new(
  rlang::quo(1.0 - p_diet), description = "1 - P(diet)", units = ""
)
q_exercise <- ExprModVar$new(
  rlang::quo(1.0 - p_exercise), description = "1 - P(exercise)", units = ""
)
```

The decision tree has one decision node, representing the single choice of the
decision problem (i.e., between the two advice programmes), two chance nodes,
representing whether each programme is a success or failure, and four leaf
nodes (intervention or no intervention for each of the two programmes).

``` r
decision_node <- DecisionNode$new("Programme")
```

``` r
chance_node_diet <- ChanceNode$new("Outcome")
chance_node_exercise <- ChanceNode$new("Outcome")
```

``` r
leaf_node_diet_no_stent <- LeafNode$new("No intervention")
leaf_node_diet_stent <- LeafNode$new("Intervention")
leaf_node_exercise_no_stent <- LeafNode$new("No intervention")
leaf_node_exercise_stent <- LeafNode$new("Intervention")
```

There are two action edges emanating from the decision node, which represent the
two choices, and four reaction edges, representing the consequences of the
success and failure of each programme.

``` r
action_diet <- Action$new(
  decision_node, chance_node_diet, cost = cost_diet, label = "Diet"
)
action_exercise <- Action$new(
  decision_node, chance_node_exercise, cost = cost_exercise, label = "Exercise"
)
```

``` r
reaction_diet_success <- Reaction$new(
  chance_node_diet, leaf_node_diet_no_stent,
  p = p_diet, cost = 0.0, label = "Success"
)

reaction_diet_failure <- Reaction$new(
  chance_node_diet, leaf_node_diet_stent,
  p = q_diet, cost = cost_stent, label = "Failure"
)

reaction_exercise_success <- Reaction$new(
  chance_node_exercise, leaf_node_exercise_no_stent,
  p = p_exercise, cost = 0.0, label = "Success"
)

reaction_exercise_failure <- Reaction$new(
  chance_node_exercise, leaf_node_exercise_stent,
  p = q_exercise, cost = cost_stent, label = "Failure"
)
```

The decision tree model is constructed from the nodes and edges.

``` r
dt <- DecisionTree$new(
  V = list(
    decision_node,
    chance_node_diet,
    chance_node_exercise,
    leaf_node_diet_no_stent,
    leaf_node_diet_stent,
    leaf_node_exercise_no_stent,
    leaf_node_exercise_stent
  ),
  E = list(
    action_diet,
    action_exercise,
    reaction_diet_success,
    reaction_diet_failure,
    reaction_exercise_success,
    reaction_exercise_failure
  )
)
```

The method `evaluate` is used to calculate the costs and utilities associated
with the decision problem. By default, it evaluates it once with all the model
variables set to their expected values and returns a data frame.

``` r
rs <- dt$evaluate()
```

Examination of the results of evaluation shows that the expected per-patient net
cost of the diet advice programme is 4,168 GBP and the per-patient net
cost of the exercise programme is 4,198 GBP; i.e., the net cost of the
exercise programme exceeds the diet programme by 31 GBP per
patient. The savings associated with the greater efficacy of the exercise
programme do not offset the increased cost of delivering it.

To estimate the uncertainty of the relative effectiveness, the probabilities of
the success proportions of the two treatments can be represented as model
variables who uncertainty follows a Beta distribution, and the decision tree
re-evaluated.

``` r
action_diet$set_cost(cost_diet)
action_exercise$set_cost(cost_exercise)
```

``` r
reaction_diet_success$set_probability(p_diet)

reaction_diet_failure$set_probability(q_diet)
reaction_diet_failure$set_cost(cost_stent)

reaction_exercise_success$set_probability(p_exercise)

reaction_exercise_failure$set_probability(q_exercise)
reaction_exercise_failure$set_cost(cost_stent)
```

``` r
N <- 1000L
rs <- dt$evaluate(setvars = "random", by = "run", N = N)
```

The confidence interval of the cost saving is estimated by repeated evaluation
of the tree, each time sampling from the uncertainty distribution of the two
probabilities using, for example, `DT$evaluate(setvars = "random", N = 1000L)`
and inspecting the resulting data frame. From 1000 runs, the 95% confidence
interval of the per patient cost saving
is -763.93 GBP
to 662.84 GBP,
with 46.3% being cost
saving. Although the exercise programme is more costly to provide than the
dietary advice programme, it is more effective and leads to saving overall
because fewer costly interventional procedures are needed. However, due to the
uncertainties of the effectiveness of each programme, it can be concluded that
more evidence is required to be confident that the exercise programme is cost
saving overall.

The method `threshold` is used to find the threshold of one of the model
variables at which the cost difference reaches zero. By univariate
threshold analysis, the exercise program will be cost saving when its cost of
delivery is less than 719 GBP or when its success rate is
greater than 31.74%. These thresholds are also
subject to uncertainty.

### A three-state Markov model

Sonnenberg and Beck<sup>2</sup> introduced an illustrative example of a
semi-Markov process with three states: “Well”, “Disabled” and “Dead” and one
transition between each state, each with a per-cycle probability. In
`rdecision` such a model is constructed as follows. Note that transitions
from a state to itself must be specified if allowed, otherwise the state would
be a temporary state.

``` r
# create states
s.well <- MarkovState$new(name = "Well", utility = 1.0)
s.disabled <- MarkovState$new(name = "Disabled", utility = 0.7)
s.dead <- MarkovState$new(name = "Dead", utility = 0.0)
```

``` r
# create transitions leaving rates undefined
E <- list(
  Transition$new(s.well, s.well),
  Transition$new(s.dead, s.dead),
  Transition$new(s.disabled, s.disabled),
  Transition$new(s.well, s.disabled),
  Transition$new(s.well, s.dead),
  Transition$new(s.disabled, s.dead)
)
```

``` r
# create the model
M <- SemiMarkovModel$new(V = list(s.well, s.disabled, s.dead), E)
```

``` r
# create transition probability matrix
snames <- c("Well", "Disabled", "Dead")
Pt <- matrix(
  data = c(0.6, 0.2, 0.2, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
  nrow = 3L, byrow = TRUE,
  dimnames = list(source = snames, target = snames)
)
# set the transition rates from per-cycle probabilities
M$set_probabilities(Pt)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-phv.png" width="417" />

With a starting population of 10,000, the model can be run for 25 years as
follows.

``` r
# set the starting populations
M$reset(c(Well = 10000.0, Disabled = 0.0, Dead = 0.0))
```

``` r
# cycle
MT <- M$cycles(25L, hcc.pop = FALSE, hcc.cost = FALSE)
```

The output, after rounding, of the `cycles` function is the Markov trace, shown
below, which replicates Table 2<sup>2</sup>. In more recent usage,
cumulative utility is normally called incremental utility, and expressed per
patient (i.e., divided by 10,000).

| Years |  Well | Disabled |  Dead | Cumulative Utility |
|------:|------:|---------:|------:|-------------------:|
|     0 | 10000 |        0 |     0 |                  0 |
|     1 |  6000 |     2000 |  2000 |               7400 |
|     2 |  3600 |     2400 |  4000 |              12680 |
|     3 |  2160 |     2160 |  5680 |              16352 |
|    23 |     0 |        1 |  9999 |              23749 |
|    24 |     0 |        0 | 10000 |              23749 |
|    25 |     0 |        0 | 10000 |              23750 |

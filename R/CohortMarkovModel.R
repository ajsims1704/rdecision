#' @title \verb{CohortMarkovModel}
#' 
#' @description An R6 class for a Markov model with cohort simulation.
#' 
#' @details A class to represent a Markov model, using cohort simulation. In 
#' graph theory terms, a Markov model is a directed multidigraph permitting 
#' loops (a loop multidigraph), optionally labelled, or \dfn{quiver}. It is a
#' multidigraph because there are potentially two edges between each pair of
#' nodes {A,B} representing the transition probabilities from A to B and 
#' \emph{vice versa}. It is a directed graph because the transition
#' rates refer to transitions in one direction. Each edge can be optionally
#' labelled. It permits loops (edges whose source and target are the same node)
#' to represent patients that remain in the same state between cycles.
